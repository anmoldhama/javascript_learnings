 Basic React Questions
Q.1) What is React and how does it work?
ans : React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building single-page applications (SPAs).
      It uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
      then first react change these into the virtual dom and then sync the virtual dom to the real dom this process is known as reconciliation in which only the changes are re-rendered not the complete dom.

Q.2) What are the key features of React?
ans : 1) Uses Virtual DOM for faster updates
      2) Highly flexible and user friendly because it is a library
      3) Have very effective state management
      4) Used to create single page applications
      5) Component-based architecture
      6) Supports unidirectional data flow (one-way data binding)   why?
      7) Easy integration with other libraries
      8) Strong community support

Q.3) What is JSX?
ans : JSX stands for javascript XML it is a format just like a html written inside the javascipt.
     Browsers don‚Äôt understand JSX, so React uses tools like Babel to convert it into regular JavaScript.

Q.4) What is the virtual DOM?
ans : Virtual DOM is a copy of the real dom which is first updated after any states changes detected in the react application and this will sync up with the real dom.

Q.5) How is React different from other frameworks like Angular or Vue?
ans : Because react is a light weight libarary not a framework
      It gives more flexibility and doesn‚Äôt enforce structure.
      not have predefined rules.
      fast because of its virtual dom.

Q.6) What are components in React?
ans : components are just the functions of code
      Components are reusable pieces of UI in React.
      These helps to modularize the code.
      They can be functional or class-based.

Q.7) What is the difference between functional and class components?
ans : Functional Components: Simple JavaScript functions. Use React hooks (like useState, useEffect).
      Class Components: Use ES6 classes. Have lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, etc.) and this keyword.  why?

Q.8) What is props in React? How are they used?
ans : Props (short for properties) are read-only data passed from parent to child components.

Q.9) What is state in React? How is it different from props?
ans : State is data that a component manages internally and can change over time.
      Props are passed from parent and are read-only.

Q.10) How do you handle events in React?
ans : Events are handled using camelCase syntax like:
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>

Q.11) What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?
ans : Controlled: Form data is handled by React state.
      Uncontrolled: Form data is handled by the DOM (using ref).

Q.12) What is the purpose of key prop in lists?
ans : key is helps the react to identify each row to manage the states.
      It improves performance during re-rendering.

Q.13) What is the difference between componentWillMount() and componentDidMount()?  why?
ans : componentWillMount(): Runs before the component mounts (rarely used, now deprecated).
      componentDidMount(): Runs after the component is added to the DOM ‚Äî used for data fetching.

Q.14) What is conditional rendering in React?
ans : conditional rendering is used to render any component on the basis of a condition
     for eg: is_admin or is_user.

Q.15) How can you style React components?
ans : CSS files

Inline styles

CSS-in-JS libraries (e.g., styled-components)

Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap

Q.16) What are fragments in React?
ans ; Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes.
     <>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</>


Q.17) What is the use of useState() hook?
ans : useState() is used to create and manage state in a functional component.
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      it has two parameters a setter function and a variable itself

Q.18) What is the use of useEffect() hook?
ans : we use useEffect() to call the callback inside the useEffect on the basis of the depenedency array
      whenever react observer any side effect inside the dependency array then react must execute the callback.

Q.19) How do you pass data between components (parent to child, child to parent)?
ans :  parent to child we have the props
       child to parent we have state up, Pass a callback function from parent and call it in the child

Q.20) What is the purpose of defaultProps and propTypes?    why?
ans : defaultProps: Set default values for props.
      propTypes: Define expected data types for props (for type safety and debugging).

     MyComponent.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Guest'
};

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string
};


üü° Intermediate React Questions
Q.21) What is the difference between useEffect() and componentDidMount()?
ans :  useEffect() is a react hook used in functional components which is on the basis of side effects
       if you not give any array then the callback is executed on every re-renders
       if you give an array then the callback is executed first time on render
       if you give an dependecy value then the callback is executed if the value changes.

       componenetDidMount is used in class based components which runs after the component mount to the ui
       it is equal to the useEffect if you give an empty array to it.

Q.23) What are React hooks? Why were they introduced?
ans : React hooks are the hooks to manage the re-renders cycle inside the functional components.
      types:
           useState() : used to create and manage the state.
           ,useEffect(): used to manage the side effects inside the functional components
           ,useCallback(): used to prevent the re-rendering of a functions.
           ,useRef(): used to prevent the re-rendering of a variable.
            useMemo(): used to prvent the complex calculations by memoizing them only triggered on the dependency array.
            , useContext(): use to get the context of the global state.
            , useReducer() : use to create and manage the complex states.

Q.24) Explain the rules of hooks.
ans : Only call Hooks at the top level
      Only call Hooks from React functions
      
Q.25) What is the use of useContext() hook?
ans : useContext hook is used to manage the state globally.
      use useContext() to create the state

Q.26) What is React.memo() and how does it help performance?
ans : React.memo(Component) is a higher‚Äêorder component (HOC) that memoizes the rendered output of a function component. It does a shallow comparison of the component‚Äôs props; if the props have not changed since the last render, React reuses (‚Äúmemoizes‚Äù) the last rendered result instead of re‚Äêrendering the component tree.

How it helps performance:

Avoids costly re‚Äêrenders of component trees when props remain the same.

Useful for pure, presentational components that render the same UI given the same props.

You can pass a custom comparison function as the second argument (arePropsEqual(prevProps, nextProps)) to control which prop changes should trigger a re‚Äêrender.

Q.27) What is the difference between useCallback() and useMemo()?
ans : useCallback() is used prevent the re-rendering of a complete function
      useMemo() is used prevent the re-rendering of a heavy calculation.

Q.28) How does reconciliation work in React?
ans : reconciliation is a process when the state change inside the react component the first the changes reflect in the virtual dom and the virtual dom get sync with the real dom an only the changes are re-rendered.

Q.29) What is React Router and how do you use it?
ans :React Router is a library for React that enables client-side routing‚Äîthat is, rendering different components for different URL paths without full page reloads.

Q.30) How do you handle form inputs in React?
ans : React offers two main patterns for handling form inputs:

     controlled components  when the state changes it will re-rendered on the ui
     uncontrolled components when the state changes it will not rendered on the ui useRef();

Q.31) What are higher-order components (HOC)?
ans : higher-order components are the componenets which receives another components as its arguments are return a new component with some modification.

Q.32) What is the Context API?
ans : Context API uses to manages the global state of an applicataion.
     Provider/Consumer or useContext usage.

Q.33) What are render props in React?
ans : A render prop is a pattern where a component‚Äôs children (or a specific prop) is a function that returns JSX. The parent component calls that function to know what to render.

This lets you share behavior (e.g., data fetching, tracking mouse position) while letting the consumer decide how to render UI.

Q.34) What is prop drilling? How can it be avoided?
ans : prop drilling is a situation when the props means data are sends to the multiple nested components.
which is very hard to manage thats why we use the useContext or Redux.

Q.35) What are portals in React?
ans : Portals provide a way to render a React subtree into a DOM node outside the parent hierarchy.

Use case examples: Modals, tooltips, or dropdowns that should visually ‚Äúescape‚Äù overflow or stacking contexts from parent components.

Q.36) What are error boundaries in React?
ans :
 An error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire React component subtree.

Only class components can be error boundaries (as of React 18). You implement two lifecycle methods:

static getDerivedStateFromError(error)

Called when a child throws an error. Update state here to show a fallback UI.

componentDidCatch(error, info)

Called after an error is thrown. You can log the error (e.g., send to an error‚Äêtracking service).

üî¥ Advanced React Questions
Q.37) What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React?
ans :  In this the complete dynamic page is prepared on the server side and send as a response to the client to render this on UI.
      

Q.38) What is hydration in React and when is it used?
ans : Hydration is the process by which React ‚Äúattaches‚Äù event listeners and initializes internal data structures on top of server-rendered HTML.

Q.39) What are concurrent features in React 18?
ans : 

Q.40) What is React Fiber?
ans : React Fiber is the complete rewrite of React‚Äôs core reconciliation algorithm (introduced in React 16) to enable incremental rendering, better scheduling, and prioritization of updates. Key points:

Fiber Data Structure

Each React element in the virtual DOM is represented by a ‚Äúfiber node,‚Äù which contains information about the component, its props, state, effects, and a link to its parent/child/sibling fiber nodes.

Unlike the older stack-based reconciler, Fiber‚Äôs linked-list structure allows React to pause, resume, and abort work easily.

Incremental Rendering & Prioritization

Before Fiber, React performed reconciliation in one go, blocking the main thread until the entire tree was updated. Fiber breaks the work into small units (‚Äúunits of work‚Äù or ‚Äúfibers‚Äù) and can interleave high-priority updates (like user input) with low-priority ones (like rendering off-screen UI).

This improvement is the foundation for React‚Äôs concurrent features (see Q39).

Phases in Fiber

Render (Reconciliation) Phase: Builds a new fiber tree by comparing current fibers to new elements. This is where React decides what changes are needed. It can be paused if there‚Äôs higher-priority work (e.g., responding to a user click).

Commit Phase: Once reconciliation is finished (or paused and resumed), React applies the changes to the real DOM in a single, synchronous ‚Äúcommit‚Äù step for each subtree.

Benefits

Time slicing: React can break work into chunks, yielding back to the browser if it takes too long.

Suspense & Transitions: Fiber underlies features like Suspense, where React can suspend a subtree if data isn‚Äôt ready, then continue rendering later.

Better Perceived Performance: UI remains responsive even during heavy updates, because React can pause reconciliation to handle user events.

Q.41) What is suspense and lazy loading in React?
ans : suspense is used to tell the components that some lazy loading is implemented in the react application.
      lazy loading is a technique in which the application is splitted into parts and rendered according to requirement. this will increase the performance because not a complete application load at a time.

Q.42) How does code splitting work in React?
ans : code splitting is a technique which is used to seperate the application into parts using .lazy()
      this will increase the performance.
      use dynamic imports

Q.43) What is the difference between strict mode and normal rendering?
ans : React‚Äôs <StrictMode> is a special component you wrap around part of your app (usually the root) to activate additional development-only checks and warnings. It does not affect production builds or change the UI. It helps you find unsafe or deprecated patterns early.

What <React.StrictMode> Does

Identifies Unsafe Lifecycles

Warns if you‚Äôre using deprecated methods like componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, or componentWillUpdate.

Warns About Legacy String Refs

Discourages using stringRef="myRef" and instead encourages callback or createRef.

Detects Unexpected Side Effects

In development mode, React will intentionally render components twice (only during mount) to detect side effects in render or constructor. If your code mutates state or interacts with the DOM during render, you‚Äôll see a warning.

Warns About Legacy Context API

Flags if you‚Äôre using the old contextTypes API instead of the new React.createContext / useContext.

Ensures Reusable State

Makes sure effects are properly cleaned up and that the same component can be safely remounted.


StrictMode vs ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù Rendering

Normal Rendering does not double-invoke lifecycle methods or warn about certain patterns.

StrictMode (development only) double-invokes certain functions (like function component bodies, useEffect mount + cleanup, and some class lifecycle methods) so you can catch unintended side effects. It also logs warnings to the console.

In production, <StrictMode> does nothing special‚Äîrendering is identical to normal.

Q.44) What is batching in React and how does it improve performance?
ans : Batching refers to React‚Äôs ability to group multiple state updates into a single re-render, which reduces the total number of renders and improves performance.



Q.45) How does React handle reconciliation and diffing?
ans : Whenever any state change happen in a react application this will first change to the virtual dom and only the changed part will sync to the real dom known as diffing and this complete process is known as reconciliation.
 This will optimize the performance of react. 

Q.46) How do you optimize a React application?
ans : 1) using code splitting by lazy loading
      2) use good builder to optimize the building time and tree shaking the code.
      3) use React.memo() for cache the rendered output of a functional component.
      4) use error bounderies if using class based component
      5) use context api or redux for global state management
      6) use useCallback() for prevent re-rendering of a function
      7) use useMemo() for prevent the re-rendering of computed value.
      8) use useRef() for creating and managing the variable which is not re-rendered on ui.

Q.47) How to implement infinite scrolling in React?
ans : Infinite scrolling means loading more data automatically as the user scrolls down, often used in news feeds or lists. A common React approach:

Track scroll position

You can listen for the window‚Äôs scroll event or use an IntersectionObserver on a sentinel element at the bottom of the list.

Example using IntersectionObserver:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from "react";

function InfiniteList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
  const observerRef = useRef();

  // Fetch next page of items
  const loadMore = useCallback(async () => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/items?page=${page}`);
    const data = await res.json();
    setItems(prev => [...prev, ...data.items]);
    setHasMore(data.hasMore);
  }, [page]);

  useEffect(() => {
    loadMore();
  }, [loadMore]);

  // IntersectionObserver to watch the ‚Äúload more‚Äù sentinel
  const lastItemRef = useCallback(
    node => {
      if (observerRef.current) observerRef.current.disconnect();
      observerRef.current = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
        if (entries[0].isIntersecting && hasMore) {
          setPage(prevPage => prevPage + 1);
        }
      });
      if (node) observerRef.current.observe(node);
    },
    [hasMore]
  );

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map((item, idx) => {
        if (idx === items.length - 1) {
          // Attach ref to the last item
          return <div key={item.id} ref={lastItemRef}>{item.text}</div>;
        }
        return <div key={item.id}>{item.text}</div>;
      })}
      {!hasMore && <p>No more items to load</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
Alternative: Listen to scroll events

jsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  function onScroll() {
    if (
      window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop + 100 >=
      document.documentElement.offsetHeight
    ) {
      // near bottom ‚Üí load more
      setPage(prev => prev + 1);
    }
  }
  window.addEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", onScroll);
}, []);
Key points:

Always debounce or throttle scroll listeners so you don‚Äôt trigger too many fetches.

Use a loading indicator while fetching more data.

Stop observing/stop fetching once there‚Äôs no more data (hasMore = false).



Q.48) How do you handle performance issues like unnecessary re-renders?
ans : useCallback(), useRef(), useMemo(), React.Memo().

Q.49) What is the difference between shallow rendering and deep rendering in tests?
ans : In shallow rendering only the top level nodes are rendered on the ui

Q.51) What are the best practices for structuring a large-scale React application?
ans : create components, pages, utils,buttons, inputs, customHooks




React Advanced & Real-World Scenario-Based Questions
Q) What are the main differences between Redux and Context API?
ans : Redux provides a single, centralized store with actions and reducers (and middleware) for complex state logic, whereas Context API simply lets you share and consume values throughout the component tree without props drilling, but doesn‚Äôt enforce a structured update pattern.
