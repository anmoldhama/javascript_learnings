# Scenario based questions


üîπ Beginner-Level Docker Scenarios (1‚Äì15)
Basic Containerization
Package a simple Node.js app into a Docker container and run it locally.

Expose App Port
Your app runs on port 3000 inside the container. Expose it to port 8080 on the host machine.

Use Dockerfile Efficiently
Convert a shell script-based deployment into a Dockerfile that builds an image.

Multi-Container Setup
Use Docker Compose to run a web app and a MongoDB instance together.

Volume Mount
You need the uploaded files to persist after the container restarts. Use Docker volumes.

Fix Broken Container
A container crashes immediately after docker run. How will you debug and fix it?

Log Monitoring
Your container logs are not showing up. How do you retrieve them and redirect to a file?

Run a One-off Command
Use Docker to run a curl test against a container without keeping it running.

Environment Configuration
Pass secret credentials as environment variables securely without hardcoding.

Rebuild After Code Change
Your app doesn't reflect changes after editing code. What might be wrong and how to fix it?

Use .dockerignore Properly
Your Docker build is too large. Optimize it using .dockerignore.

Label an Image
Add metadata to your image to indicate version, author, and build info.

Restart Policy
Set up a container with a policy that restarts on failure but not on a normal stop.

Check Image Layers
Analyze your image to check how many layers are there and which ones are cacheable.

Clean Docker System
After weeks of usage, Docker is consuming 20GB+ disk space. Clean it safely.

üî∏ Intermediate-Level Docker Scenarios (16‚Äì35)
Multi-Stage Builds
Your image is over 1GB. Use a multi-stage build to reduce the size.

Networking Containers
Connect a frontend and backend container using a custom bridge network.

Update a Running Container
Your container is running an old version of the app. Upgrade it with zero downtime.

Mount a Host Directory
Mount a local config/ folder into the container at runtime.

Reverse Proxy Setup
Set up NGINX as a reverse proxy to multiple Docker containers.

Limit Resource Usage
Constrain your container to 256MB RAM and 0.5 CPU cores.

Build Cache Optimization
Docker builds are slow due to no caching. Optimize layer ordering in the Dockerfile.

Use Docker Secrets
Inject secrets into containers without hardcoding them or exposing them via ENV.

Run Interactive Shell
Enter a running container and debug it using bash.

Run Containers in Detached Mode
Start multiple services in detached mode and manage them independently.

Debug Image Build Failures
Your docker build fails during the 3rd instruction. Debug and fix it.

Handle Port Conflicts
You get ‚Äúport already in use‚Äù error on docker run. Resolve it safely.

Different Env per Stage
Use docker-compose.override.yml for dev vs production setup.

Push to Private Registry
Tag, authenticate, and push a local image to a private registry like Harbor or AWS ECR.

Use Healthcheck
Add a healthcheck to your container to verify app is ready before traffic is sent.

Run a Crontab in Docker
Set up a cron job inside a container that executes every 5 minutes.

Handle File Permission Issues
Containerized app cannot write to a mounted host folder. Fix file permissions.

Auto-Restart After Crash
Ensure that your container restarts automatically on crash or reboot.

Use Alpine to Reduce Size
Switch from Ubuntu to Alpine as base image and fix any broken dependencies.

Create Immutable Image Tags
Set up your CI/CD to use versioned immutable tags instead of latest.

üî∫ Advanced/Production-Level Docker Scenarios (36‚Äì50)
Blue-Green Deployment
Implement a blue-green deployment strategy using Docker and NGINX.

Sidecar Container Pattern
Use a sidecar container to monitor logs or metrics from the main container.

Secure Docker Daemon
Set up TLS for Docker client-server communication.

Use Docker Content Trust
Ensure images are signed and verified before running them.

Scan Image Vulnerabilities
Integrate an image vulnerability scanner (e.g., Trivy, Clair) in your CI pipeline.

Run Docker in Docker (DinD)
Set up a container that runs Docker commands (used in CI pipelines).

Run Stateful Services with Docker Compose
Add data persistence and volume management for PostgreSQL and Redis.

Automated Backups Using Docker Volume
Use a backup container to regularly dump and archive database data.

Load Testing with Docker
Spin up multiple containers running a load testing tool like Apache Bench or JMeter.

Graceful Shutdown Handling
Make sure your app handles SIGTERM properly before the container is stopped.

Implement Rate Limiting
Use a reverse proxy container like Traefik or NGINX to apply rate limiting.

Run a Cluster with Swarm
Deploy a 3-node Swarm cluster with replication and scaling.

Monitor Docker Metrics
Use containers to run Prometheus + Grafana to monitor other Docker services.

Debug Memory Leaks in Container
Use tools like htop, valgrind, or strace inside containers to investigate memory issues.

Migrate to Kubernetes Runtime (containerd)
Replace Docker as runtime for Kubernetes nodes with containerd and validate container compatibility.
