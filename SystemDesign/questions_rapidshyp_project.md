✅ 50 Design Pattern Questions & Answers – For Your Project
🔹 General Design Pattern Fundamentals
Q: What is a design pattern?
A: A reusable solution to a common problem in software design. It helps write scalable, maintainable, and clean code.

Q: Why are design patterns important in a microservice architecture?
A: They provide standardized solutions to complex communication, scaling, and separation of concerns challenges.

🔸 Creational Patterns
Q: Where did you use the Factory Pattern in your project?
A: To select the correct courier API integration (Delhivery, Bluedart, etc.) or notification channel (Email, WhatsApp).

Q: Why use Factory Pattern for courier assignment?
A: To decouple OMS from specific courier logic and support easy addition of new couriers.

Q: What’s the difference between Factory and Abstract Factory?
A: Factory returns one product; Abstract Factory returns a group of related products.

Q: Did you use Singleton in your services? Why?
A: Yes, for database connections, Kafka producers, and Redis clients to prevent multiple instances and manage shared state.

Q: How is a Builder Pattern useful in request or event payload creation?
A: When creating complex shipment or notification payloads step-by-step before dispatching.

🔸 Structural Patterns
Q: What is the Adapter Pattern, and where did you use it?
A: It allows incompatible interfaces to work together. Used to unify different courier API formats into a common format.

Q: How did you use the Decorator Pattern?
A: For adding retry, logging, or caching layers to core services without modifying their base logic.

Q: What’s the benefit of using the Facade Pattern in your services?
A: To expose a simplified interface from complex internal modules — e.g., a unified NotificationService using Email, SMS, WhatsApp internally.

Q: When is the Proxy Pattern useful?
A: For rate limiting or access control — e.g., wrapping courier APIs with a proxy that validates requests or tracks limits.

Q: Difference between Adapter and Decorator in your project context?
A: Adapter changes API shape (e.g., courier response), Decorator adds features (e.g., logging, retries).

🔸 Behavioral Patterns
Q: How do you implement the Strategy Pattern in shipping?
A: Different courier assignment strategies are implemented and selected at runtime based on shipment type or seller config.

Q: What is the Observer Pattern in your architecture?
A: Kafka implements the observer pattern — services publish events, and subscribers (consumers) react asynchronously.

Q: Why use the Command Pattern for scheduled jobs?
A: To encapsulate actions (e.g., retryShipmentAssignment) as objects, making scheduling and logging easier.

Q: How is the Template Method Pattern used in reports?
A: Common report-generation flow is fixed (template), while specifics (filters, grouping) are defined by subclasses.

Q: Use case of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern?
A: In notification sending — if Email fails, fallback to SMS or WhatsApp using a chain of senders.

Q: Did you use the State Pattern for order or shipment status?
A: Yes, to manage state transitions (e.g., Created → Assigned → In Transit → Delivered) with logic encapsulated per state.

Q: Where is the Observer pattern useful beyond Kafka?
A: For internal event listeners — e.g., after order creation, multiple modules can subscribe to be notified.

Q: When would you use the Mediator Pattern?
A: To decouple service logic when multiple modules (OMS, shipping, notification) interact — centralizing control in a mediator.

🔸 Concurrency / Resilience Patterns (Extended Patterns)
Q: What is the Circuit Breaker pattern, and where would you apply it?
A: To prevent repeated failures from external courier APIs by "breaking the circuit" temporarily after consecutive failures.

Q: How does the Retry Pattern work in your project?
A: Background schedulers or middleware retry failed tasks like courier assignment or notification delivery using exponential backoff.

Q: Where do you use the Bulkhead Pattern?
A: To isolate services or threads — e.g., isolate shipping failures so they don’t impact OMS or report service.

Q: What is the Timeout Pattern and why is it important?
A: Prevents long waits on external systems (e.g., courier APIs); ensures services fail fast.

Q: How do you use the Idempotency Pattern?
A: In order creation and shipment booking APIs to ensure the same request doesn’t create duplicate records.

🔸 Integration & Communication Patterns
Q: Use of Message Broker pattern in your project?
A: Kafka acts as a broker for async communication between OMS → Shipping → Notifications, decoupling services.

Q: What’s the Event Sourcing Pattern, and do you use it?
A: Instead of saving final state, save all events (e.g., OrderCreated, ShipmentAssigned) — optionally used in audit or reporting services.

Q: How is Publish-Subscribe pattern used?
A: Services like Notification and Reports subscribe to events from Kafka topics published by OMS or Shipping.

Q: What is the API Gateway pattern?
A: A single entry point (like BFF) for all client calls, used to centralize routing, authentication, and validation.

Q: Difference between RPC and Pub/Sub patterns in your services?
A: RPC is used for immediate responses (e.g., API service to OMS), while Pub/Sub is used for async communication (e.g., events).

🔸 Domain-Driven Patterns
Q: What is the Aggregate Root in your domain model?
A: Order is the aggregate root in OMS; all changes to shipments or tracking go through it.

Q: Do you use Value Objects in your models?
A: Yes — e.g., Address, CourierDetails, and TrackingInfo are immutable value objects.

Q: What’s the role of Domain Events?
A: Events like OrderCreated or ShipmentFailed are published as domain events for other services to act upon.

Q: How do you use the Specification Pattern?
A: For building dynamic queries, like filtering reports or searching shipments with multiple criteria.

🔸 Error Handling, Logging & Cross-Cutting Patterns
Q: How do you use Middleware pattern in Express?
A: For validation, logging, authentication, error handling — before/after the main route handler.

Q: Where did you implement the Interceptor Pattern?
A: In outbound HTTP clients or Kafka consumers for injecting logs, auth headers, or retries.

Q: How is the Logger pattern implemented?
A: A shared logging utility wraps Winston/Bunyan with context-aware metadata like requestId, serviceName.

Q: Why use Dependency Injection in your services?
A: To decouple service logic from implementations, improve testability, and support mocking.

🔸 Anti-Patterns / Best Practices
Q: What is the God Object anti-pattern?
A: When one service or class does too much — avoided by splitting OMS and Shipping responsibilities.

Q: How do you avoid Tight Coupling in microservices?
A: By using events (Kafka), versioned APIs, and interface abstractions (e.g., Courier interface).

Q: What is the Service Locator Pattern and did you use it?
A: A central registry for dependencies — avoided in favor of explicit DI.

Q: What is the Active Record pattern, and did you use it?
A: If models directly interact with the DB and hold logic — we prefer separating into repositories and services.

🔸 Real-World Application Patterns
Q: How do you apply the Retry with Timeout pattern?
A: When calling courier APIs — retry a few times within a timeout limit, then fallback.

Q: What’s your fallback strategy in case of courier assignment failure?
A: Queue the shipment for retry in background scheduler and notify seller.

Q: How is logging structured using pattern-based design?
A: Logger is injected into each service and tagged by context (orderId, serviceName, errorType).

Q: How do you wrap database access with patterns?
A: Use Repository + DAO pattern to encapsulate MongoDB/SQL queries.

🔸 Testing & Maintainability Patterns
Q: How does Dependency Injection help with testing?
A: Allows mocking dependencies (e.g., courier APIs) in unit tests without changing service logic.

Q: What is the Test Data Builder pattern?
A: Used in tests to easily generate valid or invalid objects like orders or shipments.

Q: How do you make code extensible using patterns?
A: By coding against interfaces (e.g., CourierStrategy) and injecting implementations.

Q: What design pattern ensures open/closed principle in your architecture?
A: Strategy + Factory — lets you extend (add new couriers) without modifying existing logic.

# approach to practise the LLD

✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Practice LLD System Design Patterns
🔹 Step 1: Learn the Core Design Patterns (with Real Use-Cases)
🧠 Patterns to Master First (with your backend focus):

✅ Singleton → DB connections, config

✅ Factory → Courier service selector

✅ Strategy → Notification/courier logic

✅ Observer → Kafka-based messaging

✅ Repository → Abstract MongoDB/SQL

✅ Decorator → Retry/logging wrappers

✅ Template → Report generation, scheduling

✅ Chain of Responsibility → Fallback/validation

✅ Adapter → Integrate third-party courier APIs

📘 Use: Refactoring.Guru and JavaScript/TypeScript examples on SourceMaking

🔹 Step 2: Convert Patterns into Mini Projects
Practice patterns in the context of mini projects based on your logistics system:

Pattern	Mini Project
Factory + Strategy	Courier Assignment System
Singleton + DI	MongoDB connection manager
Observer	Kafka-based event system
Adapter	Wrap a fake courier API (e.g., Delhivery)
Repository	Order & shipment data access layer
Chain of Responsibility	Notification fallback logic
Template	Custom PDF report generation
Decorator	Add retry to API client dynamically

✅ Do each as a separate Node.js/TypeScript module, then integrate them.

🔹 Step 3: Reverse-Engineer Patterns from Real Projects
Use your own project and reverse-identify patterns:

For example:

Look at how you call courier APIs → Apply Strategy + Factory

Notification logic → Apply Observer + Chain of Responsibility

Kafka event system → Apply Observer pattern

Document:

What’s the problem?

What pattern fits?

What would a class diagram look like?

How would I refactor this?

🔹 Step 4: Re-Implement Patterns in 3 Languages
Choose 3 languages:

TypeScript/JavaScript (your current)

Java (widely used in interviews)

Python or Go (for syntax variety)

✅ Goal: To see how patterns are applied differently in typed/untyped and OOP/functional languages.

🔹 Step 5: Practice Pattern-Based LLD Questions
Use sites like:

Scaler Edge, GeeksforGeeks → LLD pattern questions

DesignGurus.io → Case studies

Excalidraw / Mermaid → Draw UML Class Diagrams

Example LLD Questions:

Design a ride-sharing app (Uber) → Observer, Strategy

Design an order service → Repository, Service Layer

Design a WhatsApp-like messaging app → Observer, Pub/Sub, Adapter

🔹 Step 6: Apply in Real Work or Side Project
Use patterns intentionally in your actual project:

Refactor existing courier logic to Strategy

Create a reusable Report Generator using Template Pattern

Move MongoDB logic into a Repository

Make notification channels configurable with Factory

Keep a GitHub repo like:
📁 lld-patterns-logistics-ts

🔁 Weekly Practice Plan (4 Weeks)
Week	Goal
1️⃣	Learn & code 5 core patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Observer, Repo)
2️⃣	Apply to mini projects (order, shipment, notification)
3️⃣	Draw class diagrams for 3 patterns using Excalidraw
4️⃣	Mock LLD interviews with pattern-based questions
