✅ Section 1: Deep Internals & Execution (10 Questions)
Q) What is libuv and how does it enable asynchronous I/O in Node.js?   stuck in interview
ans : libuv is a library written in c have the threadpool
      uv_threadpool_size by default 4
      use can extends it to 128 but only feasible to equal to cores of the cpu.
      When any I/O tasks that are cpu-intensive like dns lookups etc comes to the node application v8 engine offloads it to the libuv, libuv internally executes them with helpt IOCP windows on kernel side, kqueue for linux.
      libuv executes them in the background and return the result to the event loop callbacks.

Q) How does Node.js manage the thread pool and what is its default size?
ans : Node.js manage the thread pool with the help of libuv
     default size of libuv thread pool is 4

Q) Explain how garbage collection works in V8 and how it affects Node.js performance.
ans : garbage collection using the mark and sweep algorithm in which first mark all the reachable variables
     and them release the memory of un reachable ones it reduces the memory leaks problem 
     and the node application performance is increases.

Q) What are the different types of queues in the Node.js event loop?
ans : Two types of queues :
      microtask queue  holds the callback of promises higher priority
      macrotask queue holds the callback of timers, fs module less priority

Q) How does the --inspect flag work in Node.js, and what tools can you use with it?   stuck
ans : --inspect opens a debugging port. You can connect via Chrome DevTools or VSCode.

Use --inspect-brk to pause at the first line.

Q) Explain how async/await is just syntactic sugar over Promises in Node.js.
ans : async/await just returning the promise.
      uses try catch block for error handling
      promise used .catch for error handling
      async/await gives us the more readable syntax
      reduces the promise chaining


Q) What is the difference between Promise.all, Promise.allSettled, and Promise.race in Node.js?
ans : Promise.all returns the resolved promises if all the promise are resolved else return rejected promise and immediately short circuits
 Promise.allSettled executes all the promises no matter resolved or rejected and returns the array of objects as fullfiled values and rejected reason.
 Promise.race returns the first settled promise no matter it is resolved or rejects.

Q) What happens if you call require() inside a function? Is the module reloaded?
ans : require() inside a function loads the module from cache if previously loaded.

It does not reload the module unless you manually delete it from the cache (delete require.cache[...]).

Q) How does dynamic import() work in Node.js, and how is it different from require()?
ans : import() works asynchronously load the module parallely
      require() works synchronous manner gives the guarantee of load but have some latency to execute the further code.

Q) What is the role of the v8 module in Node.js?
ans : The v8 module exposes APIs related to V8 internals, like heap statistics.

It does not offload tasks—it only offers tools like v8.getHeapStatistics().


✅ Section 2: Real-World Asynchronous Scenarios (7 Questions)
Q) How do you create a timeout-based retry mechanism for async tasks in Node.js?
ans :
async function retryWithTimeout(task, retries = 3, delay = 1000) {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      return await Promise.race([
        task(),
        new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout')), delay))
      ]);
    } catch (e) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw e;
    }
  }
}


Q) What are async iterators and how can they be used with streams in Node.js?

Async iterators (for await...of) allow consuming stream data one chunk at a time asynchronously.
for await (const chunk of readableStream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}


Q) How do you deal with race conditions in asynchronous logic in Node.js?
ans : race conditions are the problems when the 2 or more programs try to modify the same resource at the same time this will create inconsisteny in the output.

   to prevent this use the optimistic, pessimistic locking on dbs
   use the transactions


Q) What is the difference between a callback-based and a promise-based API? Which is preferred and why?
ans : callback based api can be create a callback hell hard to debug and not readable
      and needs to implement the custom error handling logic.
      promise based api have the more readable and have .then to resolve .catch for error handling.
      also provides the parallel execution.

Q) What are some patterns for managing concurrency in Node.js?
ans : use promise apis like promise.all
      use clustering for horizontal scaling

Each instance of service is independent.

No shared memory or disk. Use external services (e.g., DB, Redis) for coordination.

Q) How would you design a rate-limited, distributed API in Node.js?
ans : you can use express-rate-limiter
      or use redis token based/slider window approach

Q) What are the tradeoffs of using microservices vs monolith in Node.js architecture?
ans : microservices are complex to manage
      have an extra workload of communction between the microservices
      occupies more space
      need extra servers

      monolith
      not scalable and not highly available
      single codebase can be crashed
      single technology used
      No parallel development for different teams

Q) How would you implement health checks and graceful shutdown in Kubernetes with Node.js?
ans : 
Use /healthz endpoints

Listen for SIGINT/SIGTERM, close DBs/connections before exiting

Q) How can Node.js be used effectively in event-driven microservice architecture?
ans : use ES modules
      use clustering
      use 

Q) What is CQRS and can it be implemented in a Node.js backend?
ans :

Node.js microservices can be split by responsibility: command handler + query handler.

✅ Section 5: Advanced Security (6 Questions)
Q) How do you prevent session fixation attacks in a Node.js app?
ans : 
Regenerate the session ID after a successful login using req.session.regenerate() in libraries like express-session.

Set secure flags:

httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'Strict'.

Avoid accepting session IDs via URLs or GET parameters.

Implement proper session expiration and rotation policies.

Q) How would you mitigate SQL injection or NoSQL injection in Node.js?
ans : use the parametrized queries
      use orms
      use input sanitization and validation

Q) What is the danger of using JSON.parse() on user input?
ans : If JSON parsing is done on untrusted input, it may throw exceptions and crash the server unless wrapped in try/catch.

Doesn't directly introduce security issues, but may be combined with prototype pollution or denial-of-service (DoS) if not properly validated.

Q) How do you protect Node.js apps from prototype pollution vulnerabilities?
ans : prototype pollution a situation when the base object is changed by the attackers then the complete application is misbehaved
      Validate and sanitize deeply nested objects (e.g., use lodash’s _.cloneDeep() carefully).

Avoid using Object.assign() or deep merges on untrusted input.

Use libraries like helmet, deepmerge, and hapi/hoek carefully.

Use Object.create(null) when creating pure data objects without inherited prototypes.

Q) What security implications does child_process.exec() have in Node.js?
ans : 
exec() executes shell commands and is vulnerable to command injection.

Never pass untrusted user input directly to exec().

Use child_process.spawn() with an array of arguments or use execFile() when possible.

Always validate and escape input carefully.



Q) How do you securely store JWT secrets and API tokens in a Node.js app?
ans : use can use the cookies with httponly , secure : true  which allow only hTTPs and not allow the javascript to access to the data.
use .env

      

✅ Section 6: Testing & Observability (6 Questions)
Q) How do you mock HTTP requests in Node.js tests using tools like nock or msw?
ans : 
Use nock to intercept HTTP requests to external services:

const nock = require('nock');
nock('https://api.example.com').get('/data').reply(200, { id: 1 });

For browser-based mocking, msw (Mock Service Worker) intercepts fetch/XHR in frontend tests
Both tools help in isolating external dependencies during testing.


Q) How would you test an asynchronous function that throws under certain conditions?
ans : Use async/await with expect().rejects or .toThrow() in Jest:

await expect(myAsyncFn()).rejects.toThrow('Some error');

Alternatively, wrap with try/catch in Mocha/Chai tests to assert the error message.



Q) What are the best practices for writing integration tests in Node.js?
Use a separate test database and clean it before each test.

Spin up real services or mock critical ones.

Avoid hardcoding ports.

Use supertest for HTTP layer testing.

Use CI pipelines to run integration tests.

Q) How do you integrate structured logging with Winston or Pino in production?
Use JSON format for logs to allow ingestion by log aggregation tools.

Configure Winston or Pino with transports to output to file, console, or cloud (e.g., Logstash, AWS CloudWatch).

| Portability    | Limited                  | OS-specific                | High (works anywhere Docker runs) |


Q) spawn() vs fork() vs exec()?

spawn()

To spawn a new process with a given command and arguments. It streams data and is ideal for long-running processes or when working with large outputs.
 Characteristics:
Returns a ChildProcess object.

Does not buffer the output. Instead, it streams stdout and stderr.

Suitable for large outputs (non-blocking).


exec()

To run a command in a shell and buffer the output. It’s easy to use but not suited for very large output due to memory limitations.

🔸 Characteristics:
Buffers the entire output and passes it to a callback.

Not suitable for large data (max buffer ~200KB by default).

Shell-specific behavior, good for one-off commands or scripts.

fork()

To spawn a new Node.js process and establish an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) channel with the parent. Only used to run Node.js scripts.
🔸 Characteristics:
Special case of spawn() optimized for spawning Node.js scripts.

Allows communication using child.send() and child.on('message').

Automatically sets up IPC channel for message passing.
