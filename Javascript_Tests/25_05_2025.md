2. Is Node.js single-threaded or multi-threaded?
ans : Node.js is single-threaded in design, but uses a multi-threaded libuv thread pool under the hood.
3. What is the difference between `require` and `import` in Node.js?
ans : In common js module we use require() to import any variable of functions  it is synchronous by nature.
      In ES module js we use import to import any variable or functions it is asynchronous by nature.
4. What is the use of the `package.json` file?
ans : Mention also that it includes metadata (scripts, entry point, version, etc.)
5. How do you create a simple HTTP server in Node.js?
ans : to create a simple http server we first import http from http.
      and use createServer() method.
      http.createServer((req, res) => {}).listen(3000)
6. What are global objects in Node.js? Name a few?

ans : The role of the process object is to accessible all the important data in the complete application.

#### Modules and File System (11-20)

11. What is the difference between built-in and user-defined modules?
ans : built in modules are the modules which are ready to use without installing or defined by the developer
      user-defined modules are the modules which are defined by the developer.
      built-in (like fs, path), user-defined (your own JS files).
12. How do you read a file asynchronously using `fs` module?
ans : we fs.readFile('filepath', (err,data)=>{
    if(err) return console.log(err);
      console.log(data);
})
13. How do you write to a file in Node.js?
ans : use the fs module fs.writeFile().  
      fs.writeFile(path, data, callback);

14. What are streams in Node.js?
ans : streams are the chunks of data which helps to prevent the buffering of complete data to the server memory
      we have 4 types of streams
       1) readable streams
       2) writable streams
       3) duplex streams
       4) transformed streams
15. Explain the difference between `fs.readFile` and `fs.createReadStream`?
ans : fs.readFile is a simple buffering to read the full file into memory.
      fs.createReadStream is a helps to read the file in streams of data.(better for large data).
16. What is the purpose of `path` module?

20. How can you check if a file exists?
ans : fs.existsSync() or fs.access().

#### Event Loop and Asynchronous Programming (21-30)

21. What is the event loop in Node.js?
ans : event loop is responsible for all the async tasks ofloads by the v8 engine
     event loop has microtask and macrotask queues which are helps to holds the callbacks
     and whenever the callstack is empty event loop moves these callbacks to the callstack for execution
     in priority.
22. How does the event loop handle blocking code?
ans : event loop offloads the blocking tasks to the libuv thread pools
      executes them parallely in background and offloads the callback to the callback queues of event loop
      and event loop moves these to the callstack.
23. What is a callback function?
ans : callback functions are the functions which are passed as a arguments to another functions for later execution.
24. What are Promises in Node.js?
ans : Promises are the objects which returns resolved and rejects in future
      promises have three states pending, fullfilled, rejected.
25. Explain `async/await` syntax with an example?
ans : async/await is a just a syntactic sugar over promises
       async function response(){
           try{
              let res = await api();
              console.log(res);
           }catch(err){
               console.log(err);
           }
       }
       response();

       In this async functions always returns the promise if you wait for an response then you should use await in front of that statement.
26. What is the difference between `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout()`?
ans : setImmediate() is executed in check phase of event loop
      setTimeout() is executed after the given time delay
27. What is the use of `process.nextTick()`?
ans : process.nextTick() is used to execute any task before the next iteration of the event loop.
It's added to microtask queue, executes before other I/O.

28. What is the order of execution: `setImmediate`, `setTimeout`, and `process.nextTick`?
ans : process.nextTick(),
 setImmediate(), setTimeout() depending on the environment.
29. How can you handle async errors?
ans :  Use try/catch with async/await, or .catch() with promises.
30. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous methods?
ans : synchronous methods runs directly
    asynchronous methods runs in parallel.
    sync blocks thread, async doesn't.

#### Advanced Topics (91-100)

91. What is clustering in Node.js?
ans : Clustering is a technique using which we can create multiple instances of a single application
      equals to the core of machine, which helps to horizontally scale the application and optimize the performance
92. How do you implement caching in Node.js?
ans : to implement caching we need to install ioRedis
      and create the connection for it
      when we requests for the high frequency data then server first check inside the redis if not present then 
      call to the main database
      we must implement the TTL and cache invalidation for real time visibility
93. What is a worker thread in Node.js?
ans : Worker Threads in Node.js allow running JavaScript code in parallel on multiple threads. Unlike child processes, worker threads share memory with the parent thread and are used for CPU-intensive tasks.

Introduced in Node.js v10.5+

Use the worker_threads module.

Useful for heavy computations without blocking the event loop.

94. What are child processes and how are they used?
ans : child processes are the seperate processes used to handle the heavy calculations seperated from the main thread to prevent the main thread block.
95. How do you send emails from Node.js?
ans : To send emails we must create a seperate service for just sending the emails because they are the less priority tasks and can be executed after some delay
      To implement this use the message stream kafka for not lossing any data.

96. How do you consume a REST API in Node.js?
ans : To consume a REST API in Node.js, use:
axios
node-fetch
Native https module

97. What is gRPC and how is it used in Node.js?
ans : grpc is known as google remote procedure call it is used in the streaming applications because 
      it transfers data in the form of a binary
      and it is using the protobuf.
      using the procedures(functions) to communicate
      It is very fast that's why used in streaming websites

      gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, language-agnostic RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for data serialization and HTTP/2 for communication.
      Use @grpc/grpc-js and @grpc/proto-loader.
      Define services and message types in .proto files.
      Itâ€™s used in microservices, real-time systems, and where performance is critical.
      
98. What is the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules?
ans : commonjs is synchronous in nature
      used exports.module and require()
      ES modules are asynchronous in nature
      used imports and named export, default export
99. How do you handle file uploads in Node.js?
ans : To upload file in node we use multer and for storage use S3
100. What are WebSockets and how do you use them in Node.js?
ans : WebSockets are the technique of creating a fully duplex two communication channel over a single TCP protocol.
      To create a socket connection first the client sends a request with the header connection -type upgrade
      the server checks that the sockets are implemented or not if present then 
      give response back to the client with the header connection-type upgrade
      and a persistent connection is created.
