✅ Section 1: Asynchronous & Event Loop (10 Questions)
Q) Explain how the Node.js event loop works and its phases.
ans : event loop handles all the async operations in nodejs in the backend it has microtask queue which holds the callbacks of promises and macrotask queue which holds the callback of timers and fs module
  It's main phases are:
     Timers – executes setTimeout() and setInterval() callbacks.

Pending Callbacks – executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.

Idle, Prepare – used internally by Node.js.

Poll – retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O-related callbacks.

Check – executes setImmediate() callbacks.

Close Callbacks – executes close events like socket.on('close').
Also, Microtasks (like process.nextTick() and Promise callbacks) are processed after each phase, before moving on.

Q) What is the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?
ans : process.nextTick() callback executes before the next iteration of the event loop
     setImmediate callback executes in check phase after the poll phase.

Q) How does Node handle blocking operations in the event loop?
ans : offloads these to libuv which have the thread pool that executes them parllely and return the response quickly.

Q) What are microtasks and macrotasks in Node.js?
ans : these the callback queue of event loop microtask queue holds the callback of promises and macrotask queue holds the callback of timers and fs modules.

Q) What happens when an async function throws an uncaught error?
ans : If not caught with try/catch or .catch(), the app throws an unhandledRejection or uncaughtException, which can crash the app unless handled using process.on() handlers.

Q) Can you explain the impact of a long-running synchronous function on the event loop?
ans : it blocks the main thread and the code stop to execute

Q) How does async_hooks work in Node.js? What are its use cases?
ans : The async_hooks module lets you track the lifecycle of asynchronous resources. It’s useful for:

Debugging async contexts

Building custom performance monitoring tools

Context propagation (like correlating logs per request)

| Use Case                             | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom CLS (Context Propagation)** | Track request context through async flows                                  |
| **Request ID Logging**               | Attach and retrieve request-specific data without passing context manually |
| **Performance Monitoring**           | Measure lifecycle and duration of async operations                         |
| **Memory Leak Debugging**            | Detect un-destroyed async resources                                        |
| **Custom Tracing Tools**             | Build in-house versions of tracing libraries                               |


Q) What is a "zombie process" in Node.js, and how can it occur?
ans : A zombie process occurs when a child process has finished execution but still exists in the process table because the parent didn’t call wait() (in Unix). In Node, if you spawn a child and don’t handle its exit, it may become a zombie.

Q) Explain how to defer function execution using setImmediate() vs setTimeout() with 0 delay.
ans : setImmediate calls first because it will come first in event loop execution cycle.

Q) How can you detect and monitor event loop lag in a production Node.js application?
ans : Use tools like clinic.js, node --trace-events, prom-client, or event-loop-lag.

Monitor response time deltas, GC delays, or use APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog).

✅ Section 2: Streams & Buffers (7 Questions)
Q) Explain the concept of backp ressure in streams.
ans : Backpressure occurs when the readable stream pushes data faster than the writable stream can handle. This causes memory build-up. You should pause reading or apply flow control via .pause() and .resume(), or use pipe() which handles it automatically.


Q) How do readable and writable streams work internally in Node.js?
ans : Readable streams emit data and end events, and can be consumed via pipe(), async iteration, or manual read.

Writable streams accept chunks via .write() and emit drain, finish, and error events. Internally, Node buffers data and flushes it according to stream logic.

Q) What is the difference between fs.readFile() and fs.createReadStream()?
ans : fs.readFile is used read the file buffer and fs.createReadStream is used to read the data as stream 
     not buffered in the server memory.

Q) How would you implement a custom stream in Node.js?
ans : const { Readable } = require('stream');

class MyStream extends Readable {
  constructor(data) {
    super();
    this.data = data;
  }

  _read() {
    this.push(this.data);
    this.push(null); // no more data
  }
}


Q) What are the types of streams available in Node.js?
ans : Four types of streams are available in nodejs are
    1) Readable Streams
    2) Writable Streams
    3) Transformed Streams
    4) Duplex Streams

Q) How can you convert a stream to a buffer and vice versa?
ans : 
Stream to buffer:

const chunks = [];
stream.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(chunk));
stream.on('end', () => {
  const buffer = Buffer.concat(chunks);
});

Buffer to stream:

const { Readable } = require('stream');
const bufferStream = new Readable();
bufferStream.push(buffer);
bufferStream.push(null);

Q) Explain how to pipeline multiple streams and handle errors properly.
ans : Use stream.pipeline() from the stream module:
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
pipeline(
  source,
  transform,
  destination,
  (err) => {
    if (err) console.error('Pipeline failed:', err);
    else console.log('Pipeline succeeded');
  }
);


✅ Section 3: Cluster, Worker Threads & Performance (8 Questions)
Q) What is the difference between the cluster module and worker_threads?
ans : cluster is a technique which helps to create multiple instances of a single nodejs application
      it scales the application horizontally
      worker_threads are used to compute the heavy calculation seperated from the main thread.

Q) When would you use worker threads instead of clustering?
ans : Use worker_threads when you need to offload CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., image processing, encryption) to avoid blocking the main thread.

Q) How do you share memory between worker threads in Node.js?
ans : Use SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics for low-level shared memory access. Also, use MessageChannel or worker.postMessage() with transferable objects.

Q) How can Node.js be scaled horizontally across CPU cores?
ans : using the concept of clustering which fork the instances equal to the cores.

Q) How would you benchmark and profile a Node.js application?
ans : Use tools like clinic.js, 0x, autocannon, node --inspect, Chrome DevTools.

Monitor memory, CPU usage, event loop lag.

Q) How does load balancing work with the cluster module?
asn : load balancer distributes the traffic to the multiple cores.

Q) What is thread pool exhaustion, and how can you detect/prevent it?
ans : Thread pool exhaustion happens when all libuv threads are busy (default 4), blocking others.

Detect via UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE, high latency, slow fs/dns.

Prevent by increasing pool size or avoiding blocking operations.

Q) How can you optimize a Node.js app for low latency and high throughput?
ans : 1) use clustering
      2) use worker threads
      3) use child processes
      4) use rate limiting
      5) use reverse proxy
      6) use caching
      7) not define the gloabal vairables unnecessarily
      8) use closures correctly
      9) must remove the listeners
      10) must clear the timers
      11) use IIFEs
      12) use pagination
      13) use indexes
      14) use lookups correctly
      15) use sharding
      16) use replica sets
      17) use partitioning

ans : controllers
      models
      services
      middlewares
      routes
      utils

Q) How do you implement graceful shutdown in Node.js?
ans : Listen to process signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM) and clean up resources:

process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
  await server.close();
  await db.close();
  process.exit(0);
});

Q) What are the best practices for structuring a Node.js backend project?
ans : 
Follow MVC or layered architecture

Separate routes, controllers, services, and models

Use environment variables

Use logging

Write unit & integration tests

Use a linter and formatter

Keep config in a single place



Q) How do you handle circular dependencies in a Node.js project?
ans : Refactor shared logic to separate modules

Use dynamic imports or service locators

ES Modules handle circular imports more gracefully (but still warn)

Q) Explain the concept of a service layer in Node.js and why it matters.
ans : The service layer contains business logic. It separates controllers (HTTP) from DB operations, making the code modular, reusable, and testable.

Q) What is dependency injection, and how can you implement it in Node.js?
ans : Dependency Injection (DI) is the practice of injecting dependencies rather than hardcoding them.
You can use libraries like tsyringe, awilix, or pass dependencies as parameters manually.

Q) How do you implement a plugin system in a Node.js app?
ans : Use an event emitter or hook-based approach:

Define a plugin interface

Load plugins dynamically (require() or import())

Let plugins register handlers or hooks into the main app

✅ Section 5: Error Handling & Debugging (5 Questions)
Q) How do you handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections?
ans : use tru catch block with async await and .catch with promises

Q) How do you prevent memory leaks in a long-running Node.js server?
ans : 1) prevent to use unnecessary global variables
      2)

Q) What tools do you use to debug a Node.js application in production?
ans : use clinic.js for memory leak
      use prometheus/ loki for monitoring
      use use devtool browser

Q) What is the difference between try/catch and .catch() for async functions?
ans : try catch used with async await
      .catch used with promises.


Q) How do you monitor and handle application crashes or high memory usage?
ans : use clinic.js
     use prometheus/ loki

✅ Section 6: Security (5 Questions)
Q) How do you prevent prototype pollution in a Node.js application?
ans : Prototype pollution is a type of security vulnerability in JavaScript (and Node.js) where an attacker is able to modify the prototype of a base object (Object.prototype), which can then affect all objects in the system that inherit from it.

Use libraries like lodash with safe functions (e.g., _.set, _.get).

Avoid directly modifying object prototypes.

Sanitize input and validate JSON payloads.

Use security linters and tools like npm audit and snyk

Q) What is the impact of using eval() or Function() in Node.js?
ans : eval() and Function() execute arbitrary code, which poses serious security risks (e.g., code injection).

They degrade performance because the JS engine can't optimize them.

Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and used in a sandboxed environment

Q) How do you securely handle environment variables and secrets?
ans : use github secrets
      use .env for local
      dont push these to the github

Q) What are common security headers you should implement in a Node.js app?
ans : use HTTPs over HTTP
      use Helmet.js
      use cors
      use cookies with secure true
      use middleware for authentication/authorization

Q) How would you protect a Node.js app from denial-of-service attacks?
ans : Use rate limiting (express-rate-limit).

Implement IP blocking/firewall rules.

Use reverse proxies (like NGINX or Cloudflare) with DoS protection.

Validate and sanitize input to prevent slow HTTP attacks.

Set appropriate timeouts and limits on requests (e.g., body size).

✅ Section 7: Modules, ES6, Tooling (5 Questions)
Q) What are the differences between CommonJS and ES Modules in Node.js?
ans : Commonjs module are synchronous in nature use .require() and exports.module
      ES modules are asynchronous in nature  use import, default export and named exports
      

Q) How does tree shaking work with ES Modules in Node.js?
ans : tree shaking is techniaue to remove the dead code from the final build

Q) What are the advantages of using ts-node or transpiling TypeScript in Node apps?
ans : ts-node helps to the application directly run without creating compiled files.

Q) How do you manage module caching in Node.js?
ans : Node caches modules after the first require(), improving performance.

You can clear the cache using delete require.cache[require.resolve('module')].

Be cautious with dynamic modules to avoid stale data

Q) Explain the difference between require.resolve and require.main.
ans : require.resolve returns the absolute path of the module
      require.main used to check the entry point of the application.

✅ Section 8: Real-World Scenarios & Miscellaneous (5 Questions)
Q) How would you handle retries and exponential backoff for failed API calls in Node.js?
ans : applied the number of api retries logic in catch block of async await function.
Exponential backoff increases delay between retries exponentially to reduce load:
   setTimeout(() => retryFn(), baseDelay * 2 ** retryCount);


Q) What strategies would you use for rate-limiting in a Node.js API?
ans : Use middleware like express-rate-limit.

Use token bucket or sliding window algorithms.

Store rate limits in Redis for distributed environments.

Q) How would you implement a job queue in Node.js with reliability guarantees?
ans : Use job queue libraries like BullMQ, Agenda, or Bee-Queue.

Backed by Redis for persistence.

Configure retries, backoff, and dead letter queues for failed jobs.

Ensure idempotency for jobs and use acknowledgements.
