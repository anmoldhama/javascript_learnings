Core Node.js & Advanced Concepts
Q.1) How does Node.js handle child processes? Compare child_process.spawn(), fork(), and exec() with use cases.
(Expect: Discussion on IPC, resource isolation, and when to use each.)
ans : node.js handle child processes by spawing a new process when the application needs to execute any script or command seperate from the application threads.

Q.2) Explain the difference between setImmediate(), process.nextTick(), and setTimeout(fn, 0) in the event loop.
(Priority order: nextTick > microtasks > setImmediate > macrotasks.)
ans : setImmediate() callbacks are executed in check phase of event loop after the poll phase
      process.nextTick() callbacks are executed before the next cycle of event loop
      setTimeout() callacks are executed in timer phase.

Q.3) How would you implement a custom caching layer in Node.js to avoid redundant API calls?
(Look for: In-memory (LRU), Redis, cache invalidation strategies.)
ans : use in-memory database as a caching layer with the counter increment logic implement as a rate limiter to prevent the abuse calls.

Q.4) Debug a memory leak in a production Node.js service. What tools and steps would you use?   implement this
(Answer: Heap snapshots with chrome-devtools, clinic.js, memwatch-next.)
ans : use chrome-devtools, clinic.js, memwatch-next 

Performance & Scalability
Q.5) Your Node.js API throughput dropped by 50% after a recent deployment. How would you diagnose and fix it?
(Check: Async profiling (0x), event loop lag, database queries, garbage collection.)
ans : check the queries, the memory leaks 

Q.6) How would you scale a Node.js WebSocket service to handle 100K concurrent connections?
(Key: Load balancing, cluster module, horizontal scaling, sticky sessions.)
ans : use the clustering, use rate limiting, use cache
      use worker threads, use child processes
      use pagination, use indexing, use correct lookups
      use replica sets for read and writes
      use load balancer like nginx for both cache and reverse proxy

Q.7) Compare worker_threads with child processes. When would you use each?
(Worker threads: CPU-heavy tasks with shared memory. Child processes: Isolation needed.)
ans : worker_threads are used for the complex calculations like the recursive calls they shared the same state
     child processes are used to execute any command or script seperated from the main thread
     don't share the same state.

Q.8) Optimize an Express.js app suffering from high latency under load.
(Solutions: Middleware pruning, JIT compiler tuning, connection pooling.)
ans : server side
    1) use HTTPs over http
    2) use clustering
    3) use caching with in-memory db
    4) use worker threads
    5) use child processes
    6) use load balancers
    7) use stateless jwt
    8) use hashes using bcrypt
    9) not declare any unnecessary global variables
    10) must remove the listeners
    11) must clear the timers
    12) use closures correctly
    13) use IIFEs
    14) use rate limiting
    15) weakmap and weakset
    16) use streams
    17) use pm2

    database layer
    1) use pagination
    2) use indexing
    3) use sharding
    4) use replication
    5) use partitions
    6) use lookups carefully
    7) use multiple replica sets for read and write

    infra layer
    1) use load balancer
    2) use auto scaling groups
    3) use fault tolerance(kubernetes)
    4) use docker for compressed image of application
    5) use ci/cd for automate the deplyement

Architecture & Design Patterns
Q.9) Design a rate-limiting middleware for a public API supporting 1000 requests/minute per IP.
(Expected: Token bucket algorithm, Redis + express-rate-limit.)
ans : 

Q.10) How would you structure a monorepo for multiple Node.js microservices sharing common libraries?
(Tools: Lerna, Yarn/NPM workspaces, CI/CD pipeline design.)
ans : 

Q.11) Implement a retry mechanism for failed database transactions with exponential backoff.
(Code: async-retry library or custom recursive function with setTimeout.)

Q.12) Design a plugin system for a Node.js framework where plugins can modify request/response flows.**
(Pattern: Middleware chaining, hook system like Fastifyâ€™s decorate.)
ans : 

Security & Production Readiness
Q.13) How would you secure a Node.js API against SQL injection and XSS attacks?
(Solutions: ORM/parameterized queries, helmet, CSP headers, input sanitization.)
ans : use Helmet.js, use parameterized queries, use input sanitization,
      use HTTPs over HTTP, use cookies, use orms, use rate limiting

Q.14) Your Node.js app crashes with EMFILE errors. Diagnose and resolve it.
(Root cause: File descriptor leaks. Fix: graceful-fs, ulimit tuning.)
ans : 

Q.15) Implement JWT authentication with refresh tokens and revocation.   implement this one
(Key: Redis blacklist, short-lived access tokens, secure cookie storage.)
ans : 

DevOps & Observability
Q.16) How would you deploy a Node.js app with zero downtime?
(Strategies: Blue-green, canary deployments, health checks, pm2 reload.)

Q.17) Configure logging in a distributed Node.js system to trace requests across services.
(Tools: Winston + ELK, OpenTelemetry, correlation IDs.)

Q.18) Design a feature flag system for A/B testing in Node.js.
(Libraries: unleash-client, rollout strategies.)

Leadership & Best Practices
Q.19) How would you mentor junior developers on Node.js async/error handling best practices?
(Topics: Proper Promise chaining, centralized error handling, async_hooks.)

Q.20) Your team argues over callback vs. async/await. How would you standardize the codebase?
(Balance: Legacy support, consistency, performance tradeoffs.)

Bonus: Scenario-Based Questions
Q.21) "A microservice fails intermittently under load. How would you lead the debugging effort?"
(Debug: Distributed tracing, logs, metrics (CPU/memory), circuit breakers.)

Q.22) "Migrate a legacy callback-based Node.js service to async/await without downtime."
(Strategy: Gradual refactor with wrappers, tests, feature toggles.)
