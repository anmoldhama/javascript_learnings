Basics (1‚Äì10)
Q.1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
ans : let and const are block scoped
    var is a function scoped.

Q.2) What are primitive data types in JavaScript?
ans : primitive data type are stored in stack
     1) string
     2) number
     3) boolean
     4) bingint
     5) symbol
     6) null
     7) undefined

Q.3) How does == differ from ===?
ans : == only compare the values not data types
      === compares valeus as well as types

Q.4) What is typeof operator? Give examples?
ans : typeof operator returns the datatype of any variables or functions.

Q.5) What is the output of console.log(typeof null) and why?
ans : object because it is a loop hole in javascript thats why it is giving the object typeof null

Q.6) Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript?
ans : Hoisting is a concept in which the variables and functions declarations are move to the top of block.

Q.7) What are template literals and how are they used?
ans : template literals are the dynamic strings concatenation technique using which you can assign the dynamic values to the strings and also used to multi line strings.

Q.8)What is the use of parseInt() and parseFloat()?
ans: parseInt() is used to convert the string type to integer value and parseFloat() is used to convert the string type to float value.

Q.9)What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?
ans : falsy values are 0, "" , null , undefined , false
      else all are truthy values

Q.10)How do you check if a variable is an array?
ans : use can check it with the method Array.isArray();

üîÅ Control Flow & Functions (11‚Äì20)
Q.11)What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?
ans : for loop,while,for...of,for...in;

Q.12)What is the difference between for...in and for...of?
ans : for...of is used only for the arrays type but for...in loop is used for any iterables.

Q.13)What is a higher-order function?
ans : higher order function is a functions which accepts the function as its argument or return a function or both.

Q.14)Explain the concept of closures with an example?
ans : closures are just a function which remembers the variables of its outer function even after the outer function completes its execution.
   function closure(){
      let count = 0;
      return function increment(){
        count++;
      }
   }

   let counter1 = closure();
   console.log(counter1);
   let counter2 = closure();
   console.log(counter2);

Q.15)What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?
ans : function declaration is hoisted
      function declaration has its own this

      function expression is assigned to a variable
      function declaration is not hoisted
      function declaration has not its own this
      they have used as a callbacks

Q.16)What are arrow functions and their lexical this?
ans : arrow functions are the function expressions 
      arrow functions has the shorter syntax
      arrow functions doesn't has its own this
      they refers this to their parent


Q.17)What is a callback function? Provide an example?
ans : callback function is just a function which is passed as an argument to another function for later execution.

Q.18)How can you implement a debounce function?  also implements the code
ans : debounce function can be implemented using the setTimeout but when the function is triggered within the given time the timer is restarted from the beginning.

Q.19)What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?
ans : synchronous code is executed line by line
      It stops the execution of the next line if the current line is taking time to execute
      asynchronous code is executed parallely if any statement takes time to exutes then 
      the execution of the next statement is starts parallely

Q.20)What is the output of:

function foo() {
  console.log(this);
}
foo();

ans : this is undefined.


üß± Objects & Arrays (21‚Äì30)
Q.21)How do you clone an object?
ans : you can create a shallow copy by just assign an object to a new variable
     but this will only copy the references of the nested objects or variables
     If you want to deep copy any object you should recurively copy the properties of the object
     or use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

Q.22)What is destructuring in JavaScript? Provide examples for both objects and arrays?
ans : Desctructuring is concept in js using which you can assign the values of array and properties of obect to the variables on the fly.

Q.23)How do you merge two arrays?
ans : using simple build in rest operator
      or  implement a logic to fist copy the array1 and then copy array2.

      function merge(arr1,arr2){
         let result = [];
        
         let count = 0;
         while(count < arr1.length ){
             result.push(arr1[count]);
             count++;
         }
         
         count = 0;
         while(count < arr2.length){
            result.push(arr2[count]);
            count++;
         }

         return result;
      }

Q.24)What is the difference between Object.freeze() and Object.seal()?
ans : Object.freeze() is used to stop the object for a new property addition as well as modification in existing properties
     Object.seal() is used to stop the object for a new property addtion but open for modification

Q.25)What are getters and setters in objects?
ans : getters are used to fetch any property of the object
      setters are used to assign any value to a property of the object

Q.26)How does object prototype chaining work?
ans : object prototype chaining works like to get the property methods of the object after apply the chaining like Object.create(), Object.assign(), Object.enteries(), Object.keys()..etc

Q.27)What is the difference between shallow and deep copy?
ans : shallow copy only copey the references of the nested properties
      deep copy copy the complete object works on copy by values

Q.28)What are array methods like map, filter, reduce, and forEach?
ans : These are used to iterate over the array element apply the logic for every element
     map() is used for the transformation of the array element but the length is same and also returned the new array.
     filter() is used to filter the elements according to the given condition it is also returned a new array
     reduce() is used to give the result in a single value for.eg sum of all the elements of the array
     forEach is used to iterate over the array elements but it returned undefined.

Q.29)How do you find unique values in an array?
ans : using array.includes method.
     push every element if it is not includes till.

Q.30)What is the output of:

let obj = { a: 1 };
let map = new Map();
map.set(obj, "value");
console.log(map.get(obj));

ans : "value" because in map() the key could be of any data type.

üïπÔ∏è Scope, Execution & Memory (31‚Äì40)
Q.31)What is the difference between global, function, and block scope?
ans : global is a scope in which the variable is accessible in a complete file to use.
      function scope is a scope in which the variable is accessible within the function if you try to use it outside it will through an reference error
      Blocl scope is a scope in which the variable is accessible within the block {}.

Q.32)What is a lexical environment?
ans : Lexical envrionment is a environment of a variable in which the variable is accessible to use.

Q.33)Explain the call stack in JavaScript?
ans : Call stack is used to executes the code synchronously
      It uses only a single thread
      Callback has mainly two phase memory allocation and code exection
       first the global exeution context is set inside the stack
       then in LIFO manner the execution context are inserted.

Q.34)How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?
ans : js uses the automatic garbage collection mechanism
       which uses the mark and sweep algorithm internally
       works like first mark all the reachable variables 
       and then release the memory of unreachable variables
      
      But is not like that developers also need some prequestion to prevents the memory leak problem
      1) Not define any unnecessary global variables
      2) implements closures correctly
      3) must clear the timers
      4) must remove the event listeners
      5) use IIFE()


Q.35)What are memory leaks and how to avoid them?
ans : memory leak is a problem when the garbage collector is not reachable to the memory occupied by the 
     unusable variables
     1) Not define any unnecessary global variables
     2) implements closures correctly
     3) must clear the timers
     4) must remove the event listeners
     5) use weakMap() ans weakSet() because these are the weak references inside the memory
     6) use IIFE()

Q.36)What is event delegation?
an : 

Q.37) What is the event loop? Explain with an example?
ans : Event loop is used to handle the asynchronous tasks that are not executed by the call stack directly
      Event loop has the microtaskQueue in which the callback of promises are placed it has higher priority of execution
       ans marcrotaskQueue in which the callback of the timers, fs modules are placed it has lower priotity

      event loop continuously watching the callback queues and callstack whenever the callstack is empty 
      event loop move the tasks from the queues to the callstack for execution.

Q.38)Explain microtasks vs macrotasks in JavaScript?
ans : Event loop has the microtaskQueue in which the callback of promises are placed it has higher priority of execution
       ans marcrotaskQueue in which the callback of the timers, fs modules are placed it has lower priotity

Q.39) What is the difference between call, apply, and bind?
an : These are used to set the context of this
     call : invokes immediately and accepts the argumetents seperately  function.call(object,arguementq1);
     apply : same as call but accepts the arguements as array . function.apply(object,[argument1]);
     bind : save the result for later use and accepts the arguments seperately function.bind(object,arguement1);

Q.40)How do setTimeout and setInterval work internally?
ans : setTimeout is accepting the callback and a timer the callbackhe generator function is used to create a pri is executed after the timer ends
      setInterval is accepting the callback and a timer the callback is exected after every time interval.

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Concepts (41‚Äì50)
Q.41)What are Promises? How do you use .then() and .catch()?
ans : Promises are the objects which has three states pending(till the promise not settled), fulfilled(if the promise is resolved) and rejected(if the promise is rejected);
      Promises are used to handle the asynchronous tasks
      It remove the complexity of callback hell
      to get the output of the resolved promise use .then()
      to get the output of the rejected promise use .catch()

Q.42) How do async/await work in JavaScript?
ans : async/await works over the promises
      async function also returns the promise
      It removes the complexity of promise chaining like .then.then.then
      Whenever you want to get the response of a statement you use the await keyword in front of that statment
      within the async function it stops the execution but 
      on outside that function the code is executing as expected

Q.43) What is a generator function and how is it different from a normal function?
ans : tvate variable
      the generators uses the yield concept
      the statements are executed on demands

      the normal functions are executed synchronously.

Q.44)Explain the module pattern in JavaScript?
ans : Javascript uses two different module patterns like
      commonjs  in which the import/export works synchronously
                In which we use require() to import anything and exports.module() to export
      ES modules in which the import/exports works asynchronouly
                In which we use import to import anything and default,named exports to export

Q.45)What are ES6 modules and how do you export/import?
ans : ES modules in which the import/exports works asynchronouly
                In which we use import to import anything and default,named exports to export

Q.46)What are Proxy and Reflect in JavaScript?
ans : Proxy allows intercepting and customizing operations on objects. Reflect provides default behavior methods that Proxy traps.
üìå Example:

const handler = {
  get: (target, prop) => prop in target ? target[prop] : 42
};
const proxy = new Proxy({}, handler);

Q.47)What are WeakMap and WeakSet?
ans : WeakMap
A WeakMap is a special kind of Map in JavaScript where:

Only objects can be used as keys.

The keys are weakly held ‚Äî meaning they don‚Äôt prevent garbage collection if the object is no longer referenced elsewhere in your code.

It does not support iteration (forEach, for...of) or methods like .keys() or .entries().

‚úÖ Use Case:
Storing private data related to an object without preventing that object from being garbage collected.

‚úÖ Syntax:

const wm = new WeakMap();

const obj = { id: 1 };
wm.set(obj, "secretValue");

console.log(wm.get(obj)); // "secretValue"

obj = null; // After this, the key-value pair may be garbage collected
üîπ WeakSet
A WeakSet is a special kind of Set that:

Only stores objects (not primitive values like strings, numbers).

The objects are weakly held, so they can be garbage collected if there are no other references.

Does not support iteration or .size property.

‚úÖ Use Case:
Tracking objects without preventing garbage collection (e.g., caching DOM elements, marking visited nodes).

‚úÖ Syntax:

const ws = new WeakSet();

const obj = { name: "anmol" };
ws.add(obj);

console.log(ws.has(obj)); // true

obj = null; // After this, the object may be garbage collected
‚ùó Key Differences from Map/Set:
Feature	Map / Set	WeakMap / WeakSet
Keys/Values	Any type	Only objects
Iterable	Yes	No
Memory-safe GC	No	Yes (garbage-collected when unreferenced)


Q.48)What is currying in JavaScript?
ans : currying is a concept of closure in which the arguments are seperated nestedly within a function.
     
      function curry(a){
        return function(b){
            return function(c){
                return a+b+c;
            }
        }
      }

      curry(1)(2)(3);

Q.49)What are symbols and why are they used?
ans : symbols are the data types in javascript
      Symbols are used to create the private variables
      symbols are used to create unique identifiers
      symbols are used to create the properties in objects.
      No two symbol values are equal.

Q.50)What are service workers and how do they relate to JavaScript?
ans : service workers are concept of browsers
      service worker is used to execute any script outside the dom
      it helps to do the offline tasks
      it helps to do any calculation outside the dom

      They intercept network requests

      Work with caching APIs (important for PWAs)


Q)  Closures reduces the memory leak ?

function createUserManager() {
  let users = [];

  return {
    addUser(user) {
      users.push(user);
    },
    getUsers() {
      return [...users]; // returns a copy
    },
    clearUsers() {
      users = []; // clear reference, helps GC
    }
  };
}

const manager = createUserManager();
manager.addUser({ name: "Alice" });
console.log(manager.getUsers());
manager.clearUsers(); // clears memory if users are no longer needed
