**100 Unique Node.js Interview Questions (DevOps-Reduced Version)**

---

### Basics & Core Concepts

1. What is Node.js and how does it differ from traditional web servers?
ans :  Itâ€™s a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.. It is differ from traditional web servers because it it only utilising a sigle thread of the operating system.
2. What are the key features of Node.js?
ans : 1) Running on single thread
      2) Non-Blocking I/O
      3) Event driven architecture
      4) Event loop can handle concurrent requests
      5) Clustering

3. Explain the event-driven architecture of Node.js.
ans : event - driven architecture refers to the event emitter which is used to emit the event using .emit
     listen the event using .on.
4. What is the role of the V8 engine in Node.js?
ans : V8 helps the Nodejs to run outside of the browser. It has callstack it manages the garbage collector.
5. What is the purpose of the `package.json` file?
ans : It holds the meta data like versions, dependencies,dev dependencies.
6. How does the Node.js event loop work?
ans : event loop has all the responsibility to execute asynchronous task parallely.
      event loop has call queues named as microtask queue which holds the callbacks of promises
      macrotask queue which holds the callbacks of timers,fs modules whenever the callstack is empty event loop moves the task to callstack for execution.
7. What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?
ans : process.nextTick() executes before the next event loop iterations.
      setImmediate() executes in check phase
8. What are the different types of streams in Node.js?
ans : We have Readable streams
      Writable streams
      transformed streams
      duplex streams
9. What is the difference between `Buffer` and `Stream`?
ans : Buffer are the data which are first downloaded in the server memory to execution.
      Stream are the chunks of data which are not downloaed completely on the server memory, stream are useful for large data sets
10. How can you handle exceptions in Node.js?
ans : to handle execeptions we have try catch block, we have .catch() method in promises

### Modules & NPM

11. What is the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules?
ans : Common js is a sync technique used as exports.module and .require() to import/export.
      ES modules are async technique used as named exports, default exports and import
12. How do you create a custom module in Node.js?
ans : You create a custom module by writing reusable functions or variables in a separate .js file and exporting them using module.exports
13. Explain the difference between `require()` and `import`.
ans : require() loads the module synchronously
      import loads the module in parallel.
14. What is the purpose of `npm link`?
ans : npm link is used to symlink a local package globally or to another local project. It's useful for developing libraries locally without publishing to the registry.
15. How do peer dependencies work in NPM?
ans : Peer dependencies specify that your package is compatible with a specific version of a dependency, but the host application must install it. They're used in libraries to avoid dependency duplication or conflicts.
16. What are `devDependencies` and when should they be used?
ans : devDependencies are used in devlopment environment like nodemon.
17. What is the use of `.npmrc` file?
ans : .npmrc is a config file for NPM where you can set custom configurations like registry URL, authentication tokens, proxy settings, etc., on a project or global level.
18. How do you manage environment variables in Node.js?
ans : use .env file with process.env.VARIABLE_NAME.
19. What is `npx` and how is it different from `npm`?
ans : we use 'npx' if we want to use any package without installing it locally.
      use npm to install and update any package.
20. How do you handle version conflicts in NPM?
ans :  To handle version conflicts:

Use npm dedupe to reduce duplication.

Use resolutions in package.json (with Yarn) to force a specific version.

Review dependency trees with npm ls.

Manually align versions and avoid conflicting packages.

### File System & Streams

21. How do you read and write files asynchronously?
ans : use the fs module functions readFile and writeFile.
22. Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous file operations.
ans : synchronous file operations are block the main thread till the operatiosn is not completed
      asynchronous operations not block the main thread they are executed parallely.
23. How do you create a readable and writable stream?
ans : to create readble streams use fs.createReadableStream() and fs.createWriteableStream();
24. How can you copy a file using streams?
ans : use fs.createReadStream().pipe(fs.createWriteStream())
25. How do you watch for file changes in Node.js?
ans : Use fs.watch() or fs.watchFile() to watch file changes in code:

### Express.js and Middleware

26. What is Express.js and why is it used?
ans : Expressjs is a nodejs framework used to create the servers.
27. How do you define routes in Express?
ans : use express router();
28. What is middleware in Express and how is it used?
ans : middleware is layer between the controllers and the client.
      middlewares are used to authentication and authorize the user,
      cache,rate limiting etc.
29. How do you handle errors in Express middleware?
ans : use try catch block or .catch()
(err, req, res, next)  special error handling middleware.
30. What are `req`, `res`, and `next` in Express?
ans : req holds the client side data
       res holds the data which is returned by the server
       next has the address of the next middleware.
31. How do you serve static files in Express?
ans : use express.static()
32. What is the difference between `app.use()` and `app.get()`?
ans : app.use() is a multi purpose method
      app.get() is a method for the get requests.
33. How do you structure a large Express application?
ans : use : 
        controllers
        models
        routes
        utils
        index.js
        services
        config
34. How can you implement authentication in Express?
ans : use jwt, sessions
35. How do you manage sessions in Express?
ans : to manage sessions save the sessions id with the ttl inside a mongodb.

### Asynchronous Programming

36. What are callbacks and how are they used?
ans : callbacks are the functions which are passed as a argument to another function for later execution.
37. What is callback hell and how do you avoid it?
ans : callback hell are the structure of multiple nexted callbacks.
You can avoid it by:
Using named functions
Using Promises
Using async/await

38. Explain Promises and how they work.
ans : Promises are the objects which are resolved and rejected in the future,
      promises have three states pending, fulfilled, rejected.
39. What is async/await and how does it improve code readability?
ans : async/await is just a simple syntax over the promises to reduce the complex promise chaining.
      which impoves the code readability.
40. What happens if an async function throws an error?
ans : we should handle it using try catch block and .catch();
