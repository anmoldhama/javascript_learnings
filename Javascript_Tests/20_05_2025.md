Basics & Fundamentals (1–15)
Q.1) What are JavaScript data types? Explain primitive vs reference types?
ans : Data types are the specific of the format of data stored with in a memory
      Javascipt has two main types of category
      1) Primitive types  stored in stack
        - String
        - number
        -boolean
        -null
        -undefined
        -Bigint
        -Symbol

      2) Non-primitive types stored in heap memory
        - Array
        - object
        -functions

Q.2) How do you convert a string to a number in JavaScript?
ans : using Number("123");
            parseInt("123");  
            parseFloat("123.45");  
            +"123" // unary plus

Q.3) Explain the difference between null and undefined?
ans : null is a value that is initialized by a developer
      undefined is a value is auto assigned to a variable if the variable is defined but not initialized

Q.4) What is the role of the prototype property in JavaScript?
ans : As javasscript is a prototypal inheritance it used the syntax like Array.prototype.method to use the methods of array.
      Prototype allows objects to inherit methods and properties.

Q.5) How can you check if an object has a particular property?
ans : 1) use hasOwnProperty()
      2)   use obj[key] === true

Q.6) What is event bubbling and how does it differ from event capturing?
ans : Event bubbling is a concept in which the events are moved in upward direct (bottom-up) from child to parent
      Event Capturing is a concept in which the events are moved from root to child nodes (top-down).

Q.7) What is NaN? How can you reliably check for NaN?
ans : NaN is special type of value in javascript which is used to validate the numeric values Not a Number

Q.8) How does JavaScript handle floating point arithmetic? Give an example?
ans : when you are comparing two floating point arithmetic like 0.2 + 0.3 === 0.5  javascript gives this false because js calculate it as 0.20002 + 0.3000003 === 0.5000005 which is not equal

Q.9) What does the new keyword do in JavaScript?
ans : new keyword is used to create the object instance  like let obj1 = new Object();
      

Q.10) Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?
ans : synchronous code executes line by line and if any huge calculation triggered then the code is wait at that line and the rest code is unable to execute
      asynchronous code executes parallely.

Q.11)How do you shallow copy an array?
ans : shallow copy only copy the high level values but only copy the references of nested arrays.

     for eg: 
     let arr2 = [...arr1];  
     arr2 = arr1.slice();  
     arr2 = Array.from(arr1);

Q.12)What is the difference between a method and a function?
ans : In contrast of javascript the prototype predefined functions are called methods
      Method: Function inside an object.
      and the functions that are created outside the prototype are called as functions

Q.13)How can you prevent object properties from being added, modified, or deleted?
ans : use Object.freeze();

Q.14)How do you create a private variable in JavaScript?
ans : use symbol()
      use IIFE
      use closures
      use generators

Q.15)What is the output of console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3) and why?
ans : false becuse these are the floating point values.

Functions & Scope (16–30)
Q.16)What is function currying? Provide an example?
ans : function currying a concept of closures in which arguments are seperated inside the nested structure of functions
     for eg:
        function curry(a){
            return function(b){
                return function(c){
                    return a+b+c;
                }
            }
        }

        console.log(curry(1)(2)(3));

Q.17)Explain the difference between call stack and execution context?
ans : call stack has the responsibility to execute the code synchronously running on a single thread
      call stack executes the code in LIFO manner
      execution context has a context of the execution a memory allocation and code execution
      first the global execution context is added and execute at the last
      the the nexted functions execution context is added.

Q.18)What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)?
ans : Temporal Dead Zone is an area starts from the top of a block till the variable is not initialize with a value
      when the let and const variable are hoisted they are not initialized with a undefined and the error occured reference error not initialized.

Q.19)How does JavaScript handle default function parameters?
ans : when no argument is passed in a function then the default value is used.

Q.20)What is a pure function? Why are they important?
ans : pure function are the functions which gives the result without any side effects.

Q.21)How do generator functions differ from regular functions?
ans : generator functions are the functions which are used as on demand execution of the statements
      regular functions are the which are created using function keyword
      Have their own this value
      Have their arguments array
      Hoisted

Q.22)What is the difference between bind and call?
ans : Both are used to set the context of this
      bind : stores the result for later use, accepts the arguments seperately like  let result = function.bind(object,arguemnt1,argument2);
      call : invokes immediately, accepts the arguements seperately like function.call(object,arguement1,argument2);

Q.23)How does the this keyword behave inside object methods?
ans : this keyword refers to the properties of the object if present if not search from parents.

Q.24)What is a closure’s lexical environment?
ans : closure's are the functions which remembers the variables defined in their outer function event after the outer function completes its exection
      lexical environment is an environment of a varible in which it is accessible to use
      
      So, the lexical scope of closure is starts from their parent where the variable is declared.

Q.25)How can you implement function memoization?
ans : memoization is a technique in which the heavy computations are stored as a cache and whenever the same input provides then this function gives the result from the cache 
      not recalculate again and again.

Q.26)How do rest parameters work in JavaScript?
ans : rest parameters collect the remaining values as an array.

Q.27)What is the difference between a synchronous iterator and an asynchronous iterator?
ans : synchronous iterator iterates over a iterable line by line whereas the asynchronous iterator iterates parallely

Q.28)What is a Proxy object and how can it be used?
ans : A Proxy allows you to define custom behavior for fundamental operations:
let obj = new Proxy({}, {
  get(target, prop) {
    return prop in target ? target[prop] : "Not Found";
  }
});


Q.29)Explain the difference between strict mode and non-strict mode?   need more clarity
ans : In strict mode there is some validation occured
      Strict mode throws errors for silent issues
      this in functions is undefined instead of global object
Non-strict mode is default mode of javascript

Q.30)How do you handle recursion in JavaScript?
ans : recursion are handle by the call stack to store all the recursive call in a stack in LIFO manner
      ans executes accordingly.

Objects & Arrays (31–45)
Q.31)What are symbols in JavaScript and when would you use them?
ans : symbol is a data type in javascript
      Symbols are used to create a unique identifiers.
      No two symbols values are equal in comparison
      Symbol is also used to create private variables
      symbols are also used as a key in objects

Q.32)Explain how the Map object differs from a regular JavaScript object?
ans : Map holds the keys of any data types
      Map is created using let map = new Map();
      To add the properties in map use map.set();
      To get the properties of map use map.get();

      Objects holds the keys of only string and symbol type
      To add the property in object use obj.propertyname = value
      to get use obj.propertyname

Q.33)How does object destructuring with default values work?
ans : object destructuring is used to assign the properties of object on the fly if any property is missing then use default values as backup.
const { name = "Anonymous", age = 18 } = {};

Q.34)What are the differences between Array.prototype.forEach and Array.prototype.map?
ans : forEach is used to iterate over the array element
       forEach returns the undefined

       map is used to tranform the array elements
       map returns the new array with same length as original one

Q.35)How do you check if an array contains a specific element?
ans : array.includes(element);
      array.indexof(element);

Q.36)How can you flatten a nested array?
ans : by applying a custom recursive logic to flat.

      function flatten(arr){
        let result = [];

        for(let i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
            if(Array.isArray(arr[i])){
               result = result.concat(flatten(arr[i]));

            }else{
                result.push(arr[i]);
            }
        }
      }

Q.37)What is the difference between mutable and immutable data structures?
ans : mutable data structure are allow modification after they are initialized with a value for eg : array
      immutable data structure are not allow modification after they are initialized with a value. for eg : string

Q.38)How do you prevent modification of nested objects?
ans : use custom deepFreeze()
      function deepFreeze(obj) {
  Object.freeze(obj);
  for (let key in obj) {
    if (typeof obj[key] === "object" && !Object.isFrozen(obj[key])) {
      deepFreeze(obj[key]);
    }
  }
}

Q.39)How does the Set object work? What are its advantages?
ans : Set is used to store the unique values.
      when you want to store the frquency of the elements in an array
      when yoy want to remove the duplicacy.

Q.40)What are computed property names in objects?
ans : let key = "name";
let obj = { [key]: "Anmol" }; // { name: "Anmol" }


Q.41)How can you merge two arrays in JavaScript?
ans : use [..arr1,...arr2];
      implement a logic like
        
        let result = [];

        while(count < arr1.length){
            result.push(arr1[count])
            count++;
        }

        while(count < arr2.length){
            result.push(arr2[count]);
            count++;
        }

        return result;

Q.42)What is the difference between slice() and splice() on arrays?
ans : slice() is used to get the set of data from the array
      slice(startIndex, endIndex);  exclude endIndex;
      slice() not modifies the original array  return a new array

      splice() is used to add,remove the elements from the array
      splice(startIndex, endIndex, a,b); exclude endIndex add the a,b in the original array
      splice() modifies the original array

Q.43)How do you clone a deeply nested object?
ans : using the custom recursive approach
    
       function clone(obj){
    let result = {};
    
    for(let key in obj){
        if(typeof obj[key] === 'object'){
            result[key] = clone(obj[key]);
        }else{
            result[key] = obj[key];
        }
    }
    return result;
}

let obj = {name: "anmol",age: 25, second: {occupation: "developer"}};

console.log(clone(obj))

Q.44)What is the prototype chain and how does it work?
ans : The prototype chain is a mechanism in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects
    like Array.prototype.map();
     

Q.45)How do you extend a class in ES6?
ans : You can extends a class using the keyword extends
     
      class Parent{

      }

      class Child extends Parent{

      }

      use can use the methods and properties of parent class within child class

Asynchronous JavaScript (46–50)
Q.46)How does the JavaScript event loop manage promises and callbacks?
ans : event loop has all the responsibility to executes the asynchronous tasks
      event loop has the callback queues named as
      microtask queue which holds the callback of the promises it has the higher priority of execution.
      macrotack queue which holds the callback of the timers and fs modules it has the lower priority of execution
      event loop continuously watching the callstack and the callback queues whenever the callstack is empty it will push the callback from the callback queues to the callstack for execution.

Q.47)What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?
ans : Concurrency: Multiple tasks are in progress at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously (can be time-shared).

Parallelism: Multiple tasks are executed simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores.

Q.48)What are Web Workers and why are they useful?
ans : Web Workers are JavaScript scripts that run in a separate background thread, isolated from the main thread.
They allow you to run heavy computations without blocking the UI, improving performance in web apps.

Q.49)How do you cancel a fetch request in JavaScript?
ans : You cancel a fetch request using the AbortController.
  const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

fetch('https://example.com/data', { signal })
  .catch(err => {
    if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
      console.log('Fetch aborted');
    }
  });

controller.abort(); // Cancels the request


Q.50)What is the use of AbortController in asynchronous programming?
ans : AbortController allows you to abort asynchronous operations such as fetch or custom tasks using a signal. It's useful for cancelling ongoing tasks (like network requests) if they're no longer needed (e.g., when a user navigates away).
