‚úÖ Core Node.js
Q) What is the difference between global and globalThis in Node.js?
ans : global is the legacy name for Node‚Äôs global object (where things like setTimeout, process, etc. live).

globalThis was introduced in ES2020 as the standardized way to refer to ‚Äúthe global object‚Äù in any JavaScript environment. In Node 12+ (and modern browsers) global === globalThis.
    

Q) Explain how Node.js handles child processes.
ans : Whenever user wants to executes any script or command outside the main threaded it offloads this to child processes they are executing in isolation.

Node.js provides the child_process module, which lets you create subprocesses that run independently of the main event loop. There are four primary methods:

child_process.spawn(command, [args], [options])

Launches a new process with a given command and arguments.

Returns a ChildProcess object with stdin, stdout, stderr streams.

Use it for long‚Äêrunning processes or large data streams, since you get a stream interface and backpressure.

child_process.exec(command, [options], callback)

Spawns a shell, runs the command inside that shell, buffers the entire output (stdout/stderr) into memory, and then calls the callback with (error, stdout, stderr).

Good for short commands when you don‚Äôt expect massive output.

child_process.execFile(file, [args], [options], callback)

Similar to exec(), but skips spawning a shell. It directly executes the given binary (file) with arguments. Slightly faster, more secure (no shell injection).

child_process.fork(modulePath, [args], [options])

Special case of spawn(). Forks a new Node.js process, loading the module at modulePath. Returns a ChildProcess that has an IPC channel open (so parent and child can send JSON messages back and forth via child.send()/process.on("message", ...)).

Q) How does Node.js implement the CommonJS module system?
ans: 
File Loading & Wrapping: When you require("./foo"), Node:

Resolves ./foo.js (or ./foo/index.js, etc.) based on extensions and folder heuristics.

Reads the file‚Äôs contents, then wraps it in a function like

js
Copy
Edit
(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    // your file‚Äôs code here
});
This wrapper provides exports, require, module, etc., as local variables.

exports vs module.exports: Inside a module, exports is initially a reference to module.exports. If you do:

js
Copy
Edit
module.exports = { a: 1 };
// OR
exports.a = 1;
both end up exporting that object to consumers of require(...).

Caching: After the first time a module is loaded, Node caches the module.exports object by its resolved filename. Subsequent require("same_path") return the exact same object (not a copy). This caching is why the ‚Äúsingleton pattern‚Äù works simply by exporting an object or instance.

Resolution Algorithm:

If the argument to require() is a core module ("fs", "path", etc.), return the built-in.

If it starts with ./ or ../, resolve relative to the current file‚Äôs directory.

Otherwise, look in node_modules/ directories up the folder tree.

Q) What is the role of libuv in Node.js?
ans : Event Loop & Asynchronous I/O: libuv is the C library that implements Node‚Äôs event loop, abstracts file system and network I/O, and provides cross‚Äêplatform support for things like epoll (Linux), kqueue (macOS), and IOCP (Windows).

Thread Pool: By default, libuv maintains a thread pool of size 4 (configurable via the environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE, up to a maximum of 128 threads). The thread pool is used for:

File system operations (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile, etc.), because many file APIs are blocking on most platforms.

DNS lookups (e.g., dns.lookup) when you use the asynchronous form (since many platforms do not provide a nonblocking DNS resolver).

Crypto tasks (e.g., hashing large amounts of data).

Userland Offloading if you choose to spawn your own uv_work_t tasks.

I/O Polling: For network sockets (TCP/UDP), libuv uses nonblocking system calls (epoll/kqueue) so it does not need a thread pool for those. It can await multiple socket events on a single thread.

Cross‚ÄêPlatform: On Windows, libuv uses IOCP (I/O completion ports) under the hood. On POSIX platforms, it uses epoll/kqueue/etc. This lets Node achieve concurrency on a single thread for most I/O operations.

Summing Up: Node‚Äôs JavaScript code remains single‚Äêthreaded, but libuv ensures that OS‚Äêlevel I/O, DNS resolution, and certain other ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù operations happen in parallel or in a nonblocking fashion.

Q) How does Node.js handle I/O-bound vs CPU-bound tasks?
ans : 
I/O‚Äêbound tasks (e.g., reading a file, waiting for a database query, receiving HTTP requests, DNS lookups, network socket reads):

Nonblocking Polling: For network sockets, Node uses nonblocking APIs (epoll, kqueue, IOCP) so that the main thread can handle thousands of simultaneous requests without blocking. When data arrives, libuv schedules your JavaScript callback.

Thread Pool for Certain I/O: For filesystem APIs (fs.readFile(‚Ä¶, callback)) and asynchronous DNS lookups, Node uses libuv‚Äôs thread pool (default size 4). The OS call happens on a separate thread; once it returns, the callback is re‚Äêqueued onto the Event Loop.

CPU‚Äêbound tasks (e.g., heavy computation, image processing, large loops):

If you simply run a CPU‚Äêheavy function (for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++);) on the main thread, Node‚Äôs event loop is blocked until that function returns. No other callbacks can run in the meantime.

To avoid blocking, you can:

Use worker_threads: Introduced in Node v10.5+, this lets you spin up genuine JavaScript threads that run in parallel and do CPU‚Äêheavy work off the main Event Loop.

Use Child Processes (child_process or fork()): Same idea‚Äîoffload the heavy work into a separate OS process and communicate over stdin/stdout or IPC.

Q) What is the purpose of the _tickCallback() function?
ans : tickCallback() is used to execute the callback before the next iteration of the event loop.

Q) What happens if you call require() inside an asynchronous callback?
ans : then the module loads synchronously.

Q) How does Node.js treat circular dependencies in modules?
ans : Circular dependencies exist in both CommonJS and ES Module systems. Node‚Äôs CommonJS loader resolves cycles by giving each module a partially constructed exports object if the other module hasn‚Äôt fully loaded yet. ES modules use live bindings (but also must guard against using an uninitialized export early). 

Q) What are binding.gyp and node-gyp used for?
ans : 
binding.gyp is a file (in JSON format) that specifies how to build native C/C++ addons for Node.js using gyp, Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúGenerate Your Projects‚Äù tool. It lists:

Source files (.cc, .cpp) to compile.

Include directories, compiler flags, linker flags, library dependencies.

The Node.js version and architecture settings.

node-gyp is a command‚Äêline tool (and a library) that reads binding.gyp, invokes gyp to generate appropriate build files (Makefiles on Linux/macOS or Visual Studio projects on Windows), then calls the platform‚Äôs native compiler (e.g., make, msbuild) to compile the C++ code into a .node binary. This .node file can then be require()d in JavaScript as a native addon.

Typical usage:

You have a binding.gyp in your npm package.

You run npm install (or node-gyp rebuild) and node-gyp builds the native addon into build/Release/myaddon.node.

In your JS code you do const myAddon = require('./build/Release/myaddon.node');

Q) How does require.resolve() work?
ans :  it returns the resolved filename (an absolute path) that Node would load.
       It does not execute the module‚Äîonly returns the path.

ans : 

Q) What is the domain module and why is it deprecated?
ans : 

Q) How does the async_hooks module work in Node.js?
ans : 
async_hooks provides a set of APIs to track the lifetime of asynchronous resources (timers, Promises, I/O handles, etc.) within a Node.js process. You can hook into four main lifecycle events:

init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource): Fired when a new async resource is created. You receive a unique asyncId for that resource, its type (e.g., Timeout, FSREQCALLBACK, PROMISE), its parent‚Äôs triggerAsyncId, and the underlying resource object.

before(asyncId): Fired just before the callback associated with asyncId is about to run.

after(asyncId): Fired right after the callback completes.

destroy(asyncId): Fired when the async resource is destroyed (garbage‚Äêcollected).

const async_hooks = require("async_hooks");
const fs = require("fs");

const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `INIT: id=${asyncId} type=${type} trigger=${triggerAsyncId}\n`);
  },
  before(asyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `BEFORE: id=${asyncId}\n`);
  },
  after(asyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `AFTER: id=${asyncId}\n`);
  },
  destroy(asyncId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `DESTROY: id=${asyncId}\n`);
  }
});
hook.enable();

// Example async operations
setTimeout(() => {
  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    fs.writeSync(1, "Inside promise after timeout\n");
  });
}, 100);

Use Cases:

Logging/Debugging: Trace how callbacks are linked across async boundaries.

Context propagation: Build a ‚Äúcontinuation local storage‚Äù (CLS) mechanism (e.g., store a request ID and retrieve it inside any asynchronous callback that originated from that request).

Performance monitoring: Measure how long certain async operations take.


Q) Explain backpressure and how to handle it in a stream pipeline.

üîí Security in Node.js
Q) How do you prevent SQL Injection in Node.js apps?
ans : using the parmeterized queries
      use HTTPs over http
      use the orms for the input validations
      use the helmet for input validations and sanitization.

      sending some security headers.

Q) How do you secure environment variables in Node?
ans : using .env but not push it to version control

Q) How can you prevent directory traversal attacks in Express?
ans : Use path.join() or path.resolve() to sanitize and normalize file paths. Avoid using user input directly in file system operations. For serving static files, use express.static which handles this internally.



Q) What is rate limiting and how do you implement it in Node?
ans : rate limiting is a technique used to prevents the abused requests.
      which limits the request per ip in an time interval

Q) How do you validate JWT tokens securely?
ans : Use jwt.verify(token, secret) from the jsonwebtoken library to validate a token. Always use a strong secret key and verify expiration and claims.

Q) How to prevent prototype pollution in JSON inputs?
ans : Validate and sanitize JSON input. Use libraries like lodash, which have fixed vulnerabilities. Avoid merging user input directly into objects. Use Object.create(null) to prevent inherited properties.

Q) What are some ways to sanitize user inputs in Node?
ans : Use libraries like express-validator, validator.js, or sanitize-html. Remove dangerous characters or scripts from input to prevent injection attacks like XSS.
   use orms

Q) How do you manage API key security in a backend app?
ans : Store API keys in secure environments (not in code). Limit their scope and use HTTPS. Rotate keys periodically. Use rate-limiting and IP whitelisting. Hide keys in client-side code (e.g., use a proxy server for secure handling).


Q) How can you prevent session fixation in an Express app?
ans : 
Regenerate session ID after login using req.session.regenerate(). Use secure, HTTP-only cookies with secure and SameSite flags. Use strong session secrets.
