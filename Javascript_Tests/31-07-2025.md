# Javascript and Reactjs (frontend)
1. What is the difference between var,let and const in js ?
ans : let and const are block scoped, are hoisted but not initialized with undefined
      var is function scoped, hoisted and initialized with undefined

2. How does the javascript event loop work ?
ans :js event loop help to execute the asynchronous task because js callstack is running on a single thread.
     Event loop executes the task in the background and have the callback queues named as microtask queue and macrotask queue
     microtask queue stores the callback of promises and have higher priority.
     macrotask queue stores the callback of timers and fs module.
     event loop continueosly checks the callstack and the callback queue whenever the callstack is empty it will offloads the tasks from the callback queues to the callstack and callstack executes them.

3. What are promises, and how do they differ from async/await ?
ans : Promises are the objects that are resolved or rejected in the future
      They have three states named as pending,fulfilled,rejected
      Async/await are just the syntactic sugar over the promises internally they are also worked on promsies.
      await is used to pause the execution of the async function till the promise is not returned.

4. Explain the difference between shallow and deep copying in js ?
ans : shallow copy copy the references of the nested properties
      deep copy copy the complete object with the nested properties.

5. What is the virtual dom and how does React use it?
ans : virtual dom is a replica of the real dom in React whenever any state changed first this should update in the virtual dom and then sync the virtual dom with the real dom this will optimize the performance of the react application and this process is known as reconcilation.

6. What is the difference beteen == and === in js?
ans : == compares values only
      === compares values as well as data type

7. Explain the purpose of React hooks. How does useEffect work?
ans : react hooks use the manage the state inside the react application use with functional components.
      useEffect is used to trigger anything on any side effect.

8. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React ?
ans : the controlled components state are managed by the developers
      but uncontrolled componenents state are managed by the React itself.

9. What is the significance of key props in React lists?
ans : key props is used to uniquely identifies the list item it helps to render the changes.

# Nodejs and Backend Development

10. What is the event driven architecture in Nodejs ?
ans : event driven architecture refers to the architecture which have the emitter and listener
      it uses the package eventEmitter

11. How does Nodejs handle asynchronous operations ?
ans : Nodejs handle the asynchronous operatiosn which the help of event loop and libuv

12. What are middleware functions in Expressjs ?
ans : middleware fnctions are executes between the request and response cycle
      they are used for rate limiting, caching, guards.

13. How does authentication work in Nodejs? Explain JWT vs OAuth.
ans : we ahenticate our nodejs application with the help of jsonwebtoken which is used to create a token and validate that token every time when the client request to the server
   OAuth is used to authenticate via any social media platform.

14. What are websockets and when would you use them?
ans : websockets are used for creating the duplex commmunication channel between client and server
     this will helpful when you want two way commmunication on a persitent tcp connection

15. How does Nodejs handle memory management ?
ans : Nodejs handle the memory management with its automatic garbage collector.
    works on mark and sweep algorithm.


# Databases and System Design

16. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases ?
ans : SQL database have the strict ACID capability
      These type dbs are used where you want high consistency and want to use transactions
      Have the pessimistic locking
      example : payment gateway
      Satisfy CP of CAP theorem
     
      NoSQL dbs have the BASE capability
      These dbs are used where you want high availability and faster response
      Have the optimistic locking
      used where you dont know the schema structure at the starting of the deveopment
      example : ecommerce platform
      Satisfy AP of CAP theorem

17. How does indexing work in databases ?
ans : Indexing optimize the performance of the database, it faster the query time
      It stores the reference of the main data with the index id in a seperate database.

18. What are ACID properties work in databases ?
ans : A : Atomicity : every transaction should completely executed or rolledback
      C : Consistency : When the operation is commited so the value on all the servers are same
      I : Isolation : every transaction is isolate from each other
      D : Durability : When any operation is commited then it is always durable. 

19. How would you scale an API to handle millions of requests per second ?
ans : At server level
      use clustering
      use worker threads
      use child processes
      use rate limiting
      use caching
      use authentication and authorization


      at db level
      use pagination
      use less joins
      use indexing
      use connection pool
      use sharding

20. Design elevator system ?
ans : 

Design an elevator system for a commercial building with:

Multiple elevators
Multiple floors
Up/down buttons on each floor
Elevator internal buttons
Elevator status (idle, moving up/down, door open/close)
Request queue
Efficient scheduling algorithm (e.g., SCAN, LOOK)

Low-Level Design (LLD) :

1. ElevatorSystem
class ElevatorSystem {
  elevators: Elevator[];
  scheduler: Scheduler;

  requestPickup(floor: number, direction: Direction): void;
  step(): void; // moves elevators
}


2. Elevator
class Elevator {
  id: number;
  currentFloor: number;
  status: ElevatorStatus; // IDLE, MOVING, STOPPED
  direction: Direction;
  requestQueue: number[];

  move(): void;
  addDestination(floor: number): void;
  step(): void;
}


3. Scheduler
class Scheduler {
  assignElevator(floor: number, direction: Direction, elevators: Elevator[]): Elevator;
}

4. Enums
enum Direction {
  UP,
  DOWN,
  IDLE
}

enum ElevatorStatus {
  MOVING,
  IDLE,
  DOOR_OPEN,
  STOPPED
}

5. Request

class Request {
  floor: number;
  direction: Direction;
}


Database Schema (SQL or NoSQL friendly) :

1. elevators
elevator_id    INT (PK)
current_floor  INT
direction      VARCHAR (UP/DOWN/IDLE)
status         VARCHAR (MOVING/IDLE/STOPPED/DOOR_OPEN)

2. requests
request_id     UUID (PK)
floor          INT
direction      VARCHAR (UP/DOWN)
status         VARCHAR (PENDING/COMPLETED)
timestamp      DATETIME

3. elevator_requests
id             UUID (PK)
elevator_id    INT (FK to elevators)
floor          INT
status         VARCHAR (QUEUED/COMPLETED)
