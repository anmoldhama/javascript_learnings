✅ Section 1: V8 Engine & JavaScript Runtime (10 Questions)
Q1) How does Node.js leverage the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code?
ans : Nodejs leverage the v8 engine built in c++ by google for chrome browser it will help the nodejs 
to execute the js code outside the browser.
 V8 compiles JavaScript directly into native machine code, enabling high-performance execution. Node.js embeds V8 to provide a runtime environment where JavaScript can interact with the system's resources, such as file systems and networks.

Q2) What is Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in V8 and how does it affect Node.js performance?
ans : Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in V8 refers to the process of compiling JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, rather than before execution. V8 uses an interpreter called Ignition for initial execution and then optimizes frequently executed code (hot code) using the TurboFan compiler. This approach enhances performance by optimizing code paths that are executed often.

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
  add(i, i);
}

In this example, the add function is called repeatedly, making it a candidate for optimization by TurboFan.


Q3) What are hidden classes in V8 and how can they lead to performance optimizations or de-optimizations? No
ans : 
Hidden classes in V8 are internal structures that represent the shape of JavaScript objects. When objects have consistent property definitions, V8 can optimize property access using these hidden classes. However, adding or deleting properties dynamically can lead to the creation of new hidden classes, causing de-optimizations.

Q4) How does V8’s garbage collector work (Scavenge vs Mark-and-Sweep vs Incremental)? little
ans : Scavenge (Minor GC): Quickly collects short-lived objects in the young generation. 
      Mark-and-Sweep : v8 garbage collector works as first it marked the reachable variables and functions and release the memory of unreachable ones.
      Incremental and Concurrent GC: Performs garbage collection in small increments to minimize pause times.

      How Memory is Organized in V8 (used in Node.js and Chrome)
Imagine the memory as a big hotel with different rooms (sections) for different types of guests (objects):

🧒 Young Generation (New Guests)
Where new objects are created.

It's fast and small (1–8MB), so it's easy to clean up quickly.

This area is split into two halves: ToSpace and FromSpace.

ToSpace: where new objects go.

FromSpace: helps during cleanup (more on this later).

👴 Old Generation (Long-Term Guests)
Where old or permanent objects are moved.

It’s larger and cleaned less often, but cleanup takes longer.

It has sub-areas like:

Old Space: normal long-living objects.

Code Space: functions or code that runs.

Large Object Space: big objects that don’t fit in other places.

Map Space: internal data structures.

🔁 How Objects Move and Get Collected
Step-by-step:
New Object → Goes to ToSpace in the Young Generation.

If object survives 1 GC cycle → it’s moved to intermediate space.

If it survives 2 GC cycles → it’s moved to the Old Generation.

🧹 Minor Garbage Collection (Young Generation Cleanup)
Called Scavenge.

When memory fills up in Young Generation (ToSpace), V8:

Swaps ToSpace and FromSpace.

Moves live objects to the new ToSpace.

Discards dead objects (they’re just gone).

If some objects are old enough → they go to Old Generation.

Example:

Let’s say we allocate objects A, B, C, D. Then we try to allocate E, but there’s no space left.

So:

GC runs.

If B and D are dead, A and C are copied to new ToSpace.

Then E is added.

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Before:
| A | B | C | D | (no space for E)

After GC:
| A | C | (space) | ← can now add E here
🏗️ Major Garbage Collection (Old Generation Cleanup)
Happens less often.

More expensive (slower) but clears a lot of space.

Uses Mark and Sweep or Mark and Compact techniques:

1. Mark: Walks through memory and marks alive objects.
2. Sweep: Clears dead objects.
3. Compact: Moves remaining objects together to save space.
✅ Mark = Identify what's alive
🧹 Sweep = Clear dead stuff
📦 Compact = Reorganize the room neatly

🚀 Optimizations to Make GC Faster
✅ Orinoco Garbage Collector
Performs GC in parallel, meaning less app pausing.

Great for modern multi-core CPUs.

Keeps main app thread free as much as possible.

Reduces pauses from hundreds of ms to just 5–10ms.

✅ Parallel Scavenger
Instead of one thread cleaning up, multiple threads clean together.

Efficient when many objects are alive and need sorting.

✅ Black Allocation
If something is expected to live long, it’s given special treatment.

Saves time in GC by not checking it again soon.

💡 Tips to Improve Performance
Short-lived objects are cheap—GC can clean them fast.

Avoid holding on to objects you don’t need.

Pre-allocate objects if you can, especially ones that won’t change.



Q5) How does Node.js handle memory allocation for JavaScript objects under the hood? little
ans : Node.js, through V8, allocates memory for JavaScript objects in the heap. The heap is divided into spaces like the new space (for short-lived objects) and old space (for long-lived objects). Memory management is automatic, with garbage collection reclaiming unused memory.

Q6) What is the generational heap model used by V8, and how does it impact memory usage in Node.js? No
ans : V8's generational heap model divides the heap into:

Young Generation: Holds short-lived objects; collected frequently.

Old Generation: Holds long-lived objects; collected less often.

Q7) What is inline caching, and how does it help speed up repeated property access in Node.js? 
ans : 
Inline caching is a V8 optimization that stores the location of object properties after their first access. Subsequent accesses can retrieve the property directly, bypassing the need for repeated lookups, thus enhancing performance.
function greet(user) {
  return "Hello, " + user.name;
}

const user = { name: "Alice" };
greet(user);


Q8) How does V8 optimize tail-call recursion, and is it enabled in Node.js?
ans : it is a technique to the call the functions at the last of the block to improve the performance of the callstack.
Tail-call optimization (TCO) allows recursive functions to reuse stack frames, preventing stack overflows. While V8 supports TCO as per the ES2015 specification, Node.js does not enable it by default due to potential debugging complexities and limited support across environments.

function factorial(n, accumulator = 1) {
  if (n === 0) return accumulator;
  return factorial(n - 1, n * accumulator); // Tail call
}
console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120

Q9) What happens internally when you use Function.prototype.bind() in V8 and Node.js?
ans : Using Function.prototype.bind() creates a new function with a fixed this context and optional preset arguments. Internally, V8 sets up a wrapper function that maintains the original function's behavior while binding the specified context and arguments.
function greet() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const person = { name: "Alice" };
const greetPerson = greet.bind(person);
greetPerson(); // Outputs: Alice


Q10) How does V8 optimize array types and how can you unintentionally cause de-optimization in Node.js?
ans : 
V8 optimizes arrays by categorizing them based on their content types (e.g., integers, doubles). Operations that change the array's type, like inserting a string into an integer array, can cause de-optimization, leading to slower performance.
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push("four"); // Causes de-optimization


✅ Section 2: Libuv & Event Loop Internals (10 Questions)
Q11) How does libuv abstract the OS I/O models (epoll, kqueue, IOCP) for Node.js?
ans : libuv is a C library that provides a unified API for asynchronous I/O operations across different operating systems.

It abstracts OS-specific I/O mechanisms like:

epoll (Linux)

kqueue (macOS/BSD)

IOCP (Windows)

This ensures cross-platform non-blocking I/O for Node.js.

Internally, libuv delegates I/O tasks (network, file system, etc.) to these native mechanisms and notifies the Node.js event loop when they're done.`

Analogy: Think of libuv as a translator that speaks to each operating system in its native language.

Q12) What are the core responsibilities of libuv in a Node.js application?
ans : Libuv is the backbone of Node.js's async model. Its core responsibilities include:

Managing the event loop

Handling I/O operations (e.g., sockets, files)

Providing thread pool for expensive operations (e.g., DNS, crypto)

Managing timers

Abstracting file system operations

Exposing async primitives (like TCP, pipes)

🔧 Example:
When fs.readFile() is used, libuv delegates the actual file read to the thread pool and then queues the callback once complete.

Q13) How does the Node.js event loop differ from the browser event loop?
ans : 
| Feature         | **Node.js**                   | **Browser**                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **I/O Model**   | libuv + OS-level I/O          | Browser APIs + Web APIs              |
| **Microtasks**  | `process.nextTick`, `Promise` | `Promise`                            |
| **Macrotasks**  | `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`  | `setTimeout`, `setInterval`          |
| **Phases**      | 6 internal loop phases        | No phases, just micro & macro queues |
| **Thread pool** | Yes (`libuv`)                 | No                                   |


Q14) What are the different phases of the Node.js event loop and their order of execution?
ans : process.nextTick() : Their callbacks are executed before every iteration of the event loop.
      promises(); : Their callbacks are executed after the next tick.

      timers : It executes the callbacks of the timers like setTimeout,setInterval
      Pending I/O callbacks : It executes the pending I/O calls
      Idle : Here is the event loop is at rest.
      Poll : It executes the callback of I/O operations , fs modules
      check : It executes the callback of setImmediate
      close : It closes the connection of sockets.

Q15) What is the difference between setImmediate, setTimeout, and process.nextTick internally?
ans : Their callbacks are executed in check phase of event loop
      setTimeout : their callbacks are executed in timers phase of event loop.
      process.nextTick : their callbacks are executed before every iteration of event loop.

Q16) How does libuv manage its internal thread pool and what tasks go into it?
ans : Libuv uses a thread pool (default size: 4, configurable via UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE) for handling CPU-bound or blocking operations.

🛠️ Tasks assigned to thread pool:

DNS resolution (dns.lookup)

File system operations (fs.readFile)

Compression/Encryption (zlib, crypto)

Custom C++ Addons

Each task runs in a background thread, so the event loop is not blocked.

Q17) What happens when an asynchronous function hits the libuv thread pool limit?
ans : If all threads are busy, new tasks are queued in the thread pool’s work queue.

As soon as a thread is freed, the next task is picked.

This can lead to increased response time if many CPU-heavy async operations run in parallel.

🧠 Tip: Use UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE env variable to increase the thread pool size if needed.

Q18) How does Node.js prioritize I/O callbacks versus timers and microtasks?
ans : process.nextTick()

Microtasks (Promises)

Timers (setTimeout)

I/O Callbacks

setImmediate()

Microtasks always run before macrotasks. So even if setTimeout has 0ms delay, microtasks will finish first.

Q19) What are the effects of a blocked event loop and how does Node.js detect it?
ans :When a synchronous/blocking operation takes too long (e.g. while-loop, heavy computation), the event loop is blocked.
Detection Tools:

clinic.js

blocked-at

async_hooks with custom tracing

Q20) How does the uv_run() function control the Node.js execution cycle?
ans :
uv_run() is the core function in libuv that starts and runs the event loop.

It keeps looping until there are:

Active handles (e.g. sockets, timers)

Pending requests in the queue

It controls the transition between phases, checks for expired timers, completed I/O, and executes callbacks.

🧠 Internally, node::Start() calls uv_run() to begin the lifecycle of your app.

✅ Section 3: Node.js Module System (8 Questions)
Q21) How does Node.js internally resolve modules using the CommonJS require() system?
ans : When you call require('someModule'), Node.js performs the following internal steps:

📦 Module Resolution Steps:
Resolve path

Relative paths → resolved from current file.

Core modules (fs, http) → resolved immediately.

Non-relative paths → resolved using node_modules directories (walking up folders).

Check cache

If already loaded, return from require.cache.

Load module

.js → Parsed and executed as JavaScript

.json → Parsed as JSON

.node → Native C++ addon

Wrap module

Code is wrapped in a function:

(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
   // your module code
});
Execute module

Code is executed and module.exports is returned.

Q22) What is the role of the Module._cache and how does module caching work internally?
ans : Node.js uses require.cache (internally Module._cache) to store loaded modules and prevent re-execution.

✅ Why caching?
Improves performance

Prevents reinitialization

Q23) How is circular dependency handled internally in the Node.js module loader?
ans : circular dependency is a dependency on the modules like module a is load after module b and module b is load after module a this is resolved by the ES modules by giving the static result of one module. The nodejs gives the module from the cache but partially executed

// a.js
console.log("Loading A");
const b = require('./b');
console.log("In A, B says:", b.message);
module.exports = { message: "Hello from A" };

// b.js
console.log("Loading B");
const a = require('./a');
console.log("In B, A says:", a.message);
module.exports = { message: "Hello from B" };


Q24) What are the internal steps taken when require('fs') is executed?
ans :  Recognizes 'fs' as a core module.

Looks it up in Node's built-in bindings.

Loads the corresponding native C++ binding for fs.

Wraps the C++ methods in JavaScript functions.

Returns the final module.

Q25) How does the Node.js loader differ between ESM and CommonJS modules?
ans : ESM modules are load asynchronously in parallel manner
      Commonjs modules are loaded in synchronous manner 

Q26) What is the role of the package.json "exports" and "imports" field in module resolution?
ans : "exports": Controls which modules are accessible when your package is imported.

"imports": Allows aliasing internal modules for cleaner imports.


Q27) How are built-in modules like http, fs, etc., bootstrapped into the runtime?
ans : 
Node embeds these core modules in its C++ source code.

On startup, modules like http, fs, net are compiled into the Node binary.

When required, they're loaded directly from internal bindings via:

process.binding('fs');
🛠️ Under the hood:

These use internalBinding() and link C++ to JavaScript APIs.

Q28) How does the vm module allow execution of code in isolated contexts internally?
ans : The vm module provides a sandboxed environment using V8 contexts.
const vm = require('vm');

const sandbox = { msg: 'hello' };
vm.createContext(sandbox); // Create isolated context

vm.runInContext('msg = msg + " world!"', sandbox);
console.log(sandbox.msg); // hello world!

 Useful for:

Sandboxing user scripts

Testing

Custom interpreters

Serverless platforms


✅ Section 4: Streams, Buffers, and Binary Handling (8 Questions)
Q29) What is the internal mechanism behind Buffer.alloc() and how is memory allocated?
ans : 
Buffer.alloc(size) creates a zero-filled buffer of the specified size in bytes.

📌 Internally:
Node.js uses libuv and V8 memory allocator to request memory.

The buffer memory is allocated outside the V8 heap (to avoid heap size limitations).

Under the hood, it uses C++ ArrayBuffer and allocates raw binary memory via malloc

const buf = Buffer.alloc(4);
console.log(buf); // <Buffer 00 00 00 00>


Q30) How does Node.js prevent Buffer overflows and memory corruption?
ans : 
Node.js prevents buffer overflows via:

Typed memory allocation

It uses TypedArray and ArrayBuffer in V8 which restrict access to allocated space only.

Length & bounds check

const buf = Buffer.alloc(2);
buf.write('hello'); // Only writes first 2 characters
Deprecation of old APIs

APIs like new Buffer(size) are deprecated in favor of safe alternatives.

Q31) How does Node.js manage chunk flow control and backpressure in streams?
ans : streams manages the backpressure using the pipeline or pipe
      and also use the .resume and .pause methods to manually implement the logic of high processing of readable streams.

Q32) What is the internal lifecycle of a Readable stream and how does it emit events?
ans :  Lifecycle Events:

new Readable() → creates internal buffer.

_read() → triggered when data is needed.

Emits:

readable: When data is ready to read.

data: When chunk is consumed.

end: No more data.

error: Error occurred.

close: Stream closed.

Q33) How does the _read() method interact with the internal buffer queue?
ans : 
_read() is a user-implemented method in custom Readable streams.

It pushes data into the internal queue using this.push(chunk).

The queue holds data until the consumer reads it (via .pipe() or .on('data')).

const { Readable } = require('stream');
class MyStream extends Readable {
  _read() {
    this.push('hello');
    this.push(null); // No more data
  }
}
new MyStream().pipe(process.stdout);


Q34) How does piping between streams avoid memory pressure internally?
ans : piping reduces the pressure of the readable streams to the writable streams by pause and resume the data transition at a regular time.

Q35) How does Transform stream use internal queues to transform data?
ans : Transform stream is both a Readable + Writable stream.

Input chunks go to writable queue.

Output chunks are pushed to readable queue after processing.

const { Transform } = require('stream');

const upper = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    callback(null, chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
  }
});

process.stdin.pipe(upper).pipe(process.stdout);


Q36) What are slab allocations in Node.js and how are they used in buffer pooling?
ans : 
Slab allocation is an optimization where Node.js pre-allocates large chunks (slabs) of memory, then slices them into smaller buffers.

📦 Why?
Avoids frequent malloc system calls.

Improves memory reuse & reduces fragmentation.

🔍 Internally:
When a small Buffer is requested:

Allocated from a pre-created slab (like a memory pool).

Once slab is full, a new one is allocated.

✅ Section 5: Async Hooks, Domains & Execution Context (7 Questions)
Q37) How does the async_hooks module trace asynchronous context internally in Node.js?
ans :The async_hooks module provides low-level APIs to track the lifecycle of asynchronous resources, like Promises, HTTP requests, timeouts, etc.

🔁 Internal Concept:
Every async operation in Node.js is assigned an async ID and a trigger ID (the context that created it).

📌 Lifecycle methods:
init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId)

before(asyncId)

after(asyncId)

destroy(asyncId)

const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');
const fs = require('fs');

const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(asyncId, type, triggerId) {
    fs.writeSync(1, `Init: ${asyncId}, Type: ${type}, Trigger: ${triggerId}\n`);
  }
});
hook.enable();

setTimeout(() => {
  fs.writeSync(1, 'Timeout executed\n');
}, 10);


Q38) How does the async resource lifecycle work (init, before, after, destroy)?
ans : 
Each async resource goes through these stages:

init – When the async resource is created.

before – Just before its callback starts executing.

after – Right after the callback completes.

destroy – When the resource is no longer needed.

Q39) What are the use cases for executionAsyncId and triggerAsyncId?
ans : 
executionAsyncId() → Gets the current async resource ID.

triggerAsyncId() → Gets the parent async resource ID (who created it).

const { executionAsyncId, triggerAsyncId } = require('async_hooks');

console.log("Execution ID:", executionAsyncId());
console.log("Trigger ID:", triggerAsyncId());

Use Cases:
Correlation ID propagation

Distributed tracing

Logging the parent-child chain of async events

Q40) How does context propagation work across async boundaries in Node.js?
ans : 
In JavaScript, due to async functions, the context (e.g., user ID, request ID) may be lost across boundaries like callbacks, promises, etc.

To solve this:

async_hooks maintains a map of async resources.

Libraries like cls-hooked or AsyncLocalStorage store and restore context.

const { AsyncLocalStorage } = require('async_hooks');
const asyncLocal = new AsyncLocalStorage();

function handler(req, res) {
  asyncLocal.run(new Map([['requestId', req.id]]), () => {
    someAsyncFunction();
  });
}

function someAsyncFunction() {
  console.log(asyncLocal.getStore().get('requestId'));
}


Q41) Why was the domain module deprecated and what were its internal flaws?
ans : 
domain module was designed to catch errors across async boundaries, but had serious flaws:

❌ Flaws:
Unreliable in Promises and newer async patterns.

Leaked context or failed to restore it correctly.

Poor error isolation — could crash unrelated parts of the app.

Q42) How do tools like OpenTelemetry use async_hooks for distributed tracing?
ans : 
OpenTelemetry uses async_hooks under the hood to:

Track request/trace IDs across async operations.

Build a trace tree of operations with parent-child relationships.

Record latency, errors, spans etc.

🧠 Key Mechanism:
Hook into init() and before() of async_hooks to inject context and restore it later.

Use AsyncLocalStorage for thread-local style storage.

Q43) How does Node.js internally track call stacks across asynchronous executions?
ans : 
V8 does not preserve the call stack across async calls by default. But Node.js reconstructs it using:

async_hooks to track async resource links.

Error.prepareStackTrace to enrich stack traces.

Long stack traces in test/debug tools (like Jest, Mocha).

async function a() {
  await b();
}
async function b() {
  throw new Error('Oops');
}
a().catch(console.error);


✅ Section 6: Native Bindings, C++ Internals, and System Calls (7 Questions)
Q44) How are Node.js built-in modules implemented in C++ and exposed to JavaScript?
ans :
Node.js is a hybrid C++ + JavaScript runtime. Core modules like fs, http, crypto, etc., are:

Written in C++, compiled into the Node binary

Exposed to JavaScript using V8 APIs

🧠 Process Flow:
Native C++ code (e.g. fs.cc) does the low-level logic.

node_binding.cc registers the module with V8.

JS wrappers in /lib/*.js (e.g. lib/fs.js) call the native code using a bridge.

Q45) What is NAN (Native Abstractions for Node.js), and how does it help create native addons?
NAN is a C++ header-based abstraction layer for building Node.js native addons that work across V8 versions.

✅ Why Use NAN?
V8 APIs change across versions (breaking C++ addons).

NAN provides a stable API, shielding you from V8 changes.

🔍 Use Case:
You want to write a high-performance crypto or image-processing addon in C++ and expose it to JS

Q46) What is the role of the V8 API in exposing native bindings to JavaScript?
ans :
V8 provides the glue between C++ and JS. Its C++ API enables you to:

Create JavaScript objects/functions from C++

Set and get properties

Call functions

🔍 Common V8 API Objects:
v8::Isolate → Represents a V8 instance

v8::Local, v8::Persistent → Object handles

v8::FunctionCallbackInfo → Function args/return

V8 gives low-level access to heap, context, and the entire JS execution environment.

Q47) How does Node.js communicate with the operating system for low-level file I/O?
ans :

Node.js uses libuv to perform low-level OS calls like file read/write, sockets, pipes, etc.

➡ Internally:

JavaScript calls fs.readFile

It maps to native C++ code (fs.cc)

That invokes libuv's uv_fs_read(), which:

Calls read() on Linux

Calls ReadFile() on Windows

Result is passed back to the JS callback.

✅ Node.js becomes cross-platform because libuv abstracts OS-level calls.

Q48) What is the lifecycle of a Node.js native extension (.node file)?
ans :
A .node file is a shared object file (.so/.dll) compiled from C++ code using node-gyp.

🔁 Lifecycle:
You compile C++ code with node-gyp, producing addon.node.

Node.js loads it with process.dlopen().

The NODE_MODULE() macro registers your addon with V8.

Exposed functions become callable in JS.

Q49) How are file descriptors managed and reused internally in Node.js?
ans :
A file descriptor (FD) is a number that uniquely identifies an open file/socket.

When you open a file, libuv gets an FD via the OS.

Node.js uses it in its I/O operations.

When the file is closed, the FD is returned to OS for reuse.

🧠 FD Pooling:
Node does not pool FDs, but relies on the OS to reuse freed ones.

You can run out of FDs if you don’t close files properly.

const fs = require('fs');

fs.open('data.txt', 'r', (err, fd) => {
  fs.read(fd, Buffer.alloc(100), 0, 100, 0, () => {
    fs.close(fd, () => console.log('Closed'));
  });
});


Q50) How does Node.js handle signals (like SIGINT, SIGTERM) and pass them to the runtime?
ans :
Node.js listens to Unix signals using libuv.
SIGINT: Ctrl + C

SIGTERM: kill command

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  console.log('Caught SIGINT');
  process.exit(0);
});

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('Graceful shutdown');
});



 Internals:
libuv listens to signals with uv_signal_start().

When received, it adds a callback to Node’s event loop queue.

✅ Used to gracefully stop servers, clean resources, etc.
