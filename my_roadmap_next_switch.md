Phase 2 (Days 31â€“60: Acceleration)

âœ… Goals: Confidence in DSA + Dive deeper into AWS + Start HLD case studies.

Daily Routine

DSA (2 hrs): 3 questions/day (1 easy warm-up, 2 medium). Weekend: 1 hard problem.

System Design (1.5 hrs): Start case studies (Design URL shortener, WhatsApp, Uber, Netflix).

AWS (1 hr): Hands-on with EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, VPC, IAM.

Core Backend (0.5 hr): Caching strategies, CQRS, Event-driven architecture.

LinkedIn:

Post 2 times per week about solving a problem (e.g., "I designed URL shortener, hereâ€™s how I handled DB scaling").

Phase 3 (Days 61â€“90: Deep Prep)

âœ… Goals: Strong DSA consistency + Confident System Design + AWS Projects.

Daily Routine

DSA (2 hrs): 3â€“4 questions daily. Start company-wise patterns (Google, Amazon, Microsoft tags on LeetCode).

System Design (2 hrs): Pick 1 real-world case study per week â†’ Write blog/LinkedIn post.

AWS (1 hr): Build 2 hands-on projects (e.g., Deploying a scalable Node.js service with Load Balancer + Auto Scaling + RDS).

Behavioral/Resume (0.5 hr): Draft STAR answers, polish resume.

LinkedIn:

2â€“3 posts/week. Share small AWS projects and design insights.

Phase 4 (Days 91â€“120: Interview Simulation)

âœ… Goals: Mock interview phase â†’ Identify weak areas.

Daily Routine

DSA (2 hrs): Mix easy/medium/hard. Focus on blind-75 + top-150 list.

System Design (1.5 hrs): Mock interview style explanation (record yourself).

AWS (1 hr): Review services, cost optimization, security (IAM, Secrets Manager).

Mock Interviews (1â€“2/week): Pramp/Peers/InterviewBuddy.

LinkedIn:

Share interview journey insights, personal learning posts.

Phase 5 (Days 121â€“150: Final Prep & Applications)

âœ… Goals: Polish + Apply Aggressively + Network.

Daily Routine

DSA (2 hrs): Only mixed timed practice (mock contests, company-specific patterns).

System Design (2 hrs): Re-revise top 15 case studies.

AWS (0.5â€“1 hr): Last-mile review.

Applications (1 hr): Target Product-Based Companies (Amazon, Uber, Microsoft, Flipkart, Razorpay, CRED, Meesho, Gojek).

LinkedIn:

Post 3x per week about your journey + connect with recruiters.

ðŸ“Œ Weekly Milestones

By Day 30: Blind 75 almost done, AWS core services revised.

By Day 60: At least 4 system design case studies done, AWS deployment project live.

By Day 90: 150+ DSA problems, 8+ case studies, 2 AWS projects.

By Day 120: Mock interviews regularly, 250+ DSA problems.

By Day 150: Ready for final interviews, polished resume + referral network active.

ðŸŽ¯ Next Role to Target for 50 LPA

Senior Software Engineer / Backend Engineer (L4â€“L5 level) at FAANG/Top Product.

System Design heavy rounds â†’ Your AWS + Design prep will differentiate you.

Target companies: Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, Google (L4), Flipkart, Razorpay, CRED, Meesho, Gojek, Atlassian.




ðŸŸ¢ 1. Low-Level Design (LLD)

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: OOP, design patterns, coding structured solutions.

What you need to learn

OOP Principles â€“ SOLID, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, interfaces.

Design Patterns â€“

Creational: Factory, Builder, Singleton

Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy

Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, State, Chain of Responsibility

Coding LLD problems â€“

Elevator System

BookMyShow

Splitwise

Parking Lot

Hotel Booking

Food Delivery (Zomato/Swiggy)

Rate Limiter

Cache (LRU/LFU)

How to Learn

Start with Head First Design Patterns (book, beginner-friendly).

Then move to Refactoring Guru website â†’ excellent visuals.

Practice implementing patterns in Java or TypeScript (since youâ€™re already using them).

Solve LLD case studies: Strive to code working solutions, not just theory.


ðŸ”µ 2. High-Level Design (HLD)

ðŸ‘‰ Focus: Scalability, distributed systems, real-world architectures.

What you need to learn

Fundamentals of Distributed Systems

Load Balancers, Caching, Database Sharding/Replication, CAP Theorem

Messaging Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), Event-Driven Architecture

Consistency models (Strong, Eventual)

Microservices vs Monoliths

System Design Components

API Gateway, Rate Limiter, CDN, Storage (S3, Blob, GFS), Search (ElasticSearch), Logging/Monitoring

Authentication & Authorization

Case Studies (Most asked in FAANG & startups)

Design URL Shortener

Design WhatsApp/Chat System

Design YouTube

Design Twitter Feed

Design Uber

Design Amazon/Flipkart scale e-commerce

Design Payment System (UPI, Razorpay, PayPal)

Trade-offs â€“ Always mention why you chose X over Y (SQL vs NoSQL, push vs pull, polling vs WebSocket, etc.).

How to Learn

Book: Grokking System Design (very structured for beginners).

Then â†’ System Design Primer (GitHub) â€“ gold standard.

YouTube Channels: Gaurav Sen, Hussein Nasser.

Apply knowledge to your own projects (deploy small microservices on AWS).
