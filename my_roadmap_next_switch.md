🟢 1. Low-Level Design (LLD)

👉 Focus: OOP, design patterns, coding structured solutions.

What you need to learn

OOP Principles – SOLID, inheritance, polymorphism, composition, interfaces.

Design Patterns –

Creational: Factory, Builder, Singleton

Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy

Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, State, Chain of Responsibility

Coding LLD problems –

Elevator System

BookMyShow

Splitwise

Parking Lot

Hotel Booking

Food Delivery (Zomato/Swiggy)

Rate Limiter

Cache (LRU/LFU)

How to Learn

Start with Head First Design Patterns (book, beginner-friendly).

Then move to Refactoring Guru website → excellent visuals.

Practice implementing patterns in Java or TypeScript (since you’re already using them).

Solve LLD case studies: Strive to code working solutions, not just theory.


🔵 2. High-Level Design (HLD)

👉 Focus: Scalability, distributed systems, real-world architectures.

What you need to learn

Fundamentals of Distributed Systems

Load Balancers, Caching, Database Sharding/Replication, CAP Theorem

Messaging Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), Event-Driven Architecture

Consistency models (Strong, Eventual)

Microservices vs Monoliths

System Design Components

API Gateway, Rate Limiter, CDN, Storage (S3, Blob, GFS), Search (ElasticSearch), Logging/Monitoring

Authentication & Authorization

Case Studies (Most asked in FAANG & startups)

Design URL Shortener

Design WhatsApp/Chat System

Design YouTube

Design Twitter Feed

Design Uber

Design Amazon/Flipkart scale e-commerce

Design Payment System (UPI, Razorpay, PayPal)

Trade-offs – Always mention why you chose X over Y (SQL vs NoSQL, push vs pull, polling vs WebSocket, etc.).

How to Learn

Book: Grokking System Design (very structured for beginners).

Then → System Design Primer (GitHub) – gold standard.

YouTube Channels: Gaurav Sen, Hussein Nasser.

Apply knowledge to your own projects (deploy small microservices on AWS).



🟢 LLD Notes (Low-Level Design)
For each LLD problem/case study, capture:

Problem Statement

Write the requirement in 2–3 lines (e.g., “Design a Parking Lot with multiple floors and different vehicle types”).

Functional Requirements

Features the system must support (book slot, exit vehicle, show availability).

Non-Functional Requirements (if any)

Performance, extensibility, concurrency (e.g., thread safety in cache).

Class Diagram

Entities, relationships (UML or hand-drawn).

Identify inheritance, composition, and associations.

Design Patterns Used

Which pattern(s) and why? (Factory for vehicle creation, Strategy for billing, etc.)

Key Classes & Interfaces (pseudo-code or snippets)

Show important class definitions & methods.

Trade-offs & Alternatives

Why Singleton vs static class? Why Strategy vs if-else?

Edge Cases & Extensions

What happens if parking is full? How to add a new vehicle type?

🔵 HLD Notes (High-Level Design)
For each HLD case study, capture:

Problem Statement & Scale

e.g., “Design WhatsApp for 50M daily active users.”

Functional Requirements

Must-have features (send message, group chat, online/offline).

Non-Functional Requirements

Scale, latency, availability, durability, fault-tolerance, cost constraints.

High-Level Architecture Diagram

Show client → load balancer → services → DB/cache/message queues.

Clearly label components.

Key Components & Responsibilities

DB choice (SQL vs NoSQL), Cache layer (Redis), Message Queue (Kafka), CDN, API Gateway, etc.

Data Modeling

Core DB schema (tables/collections) or data flow.

Scaling Strategies

Sharding, replication, partitioning, eventual consistency vs strong consistency.

Trade-offs

Why WebSockets over polling? Why Cassandra over MongoDB?

Bottlenecks & Future Extensions

What could break at 100M users?

How would you extend to handle more scale or new features?

LLD → Always include UML diagrams, OOP concepts, patterns, code snippets, extensibility.

HLD → Always cover functional + non-functional requirements, scaling, DB choice, cache, queues, diagrams, trade-offs.

Balance → Solve ~2 per week (1 LLD + 1 HLD). In 15 weeks (≈3.5 months) you’ll master all 30.

60-Day Open Source Node.js Contribution Plan
Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1–15)

👉 Goal: Learn workflows, explore repos, and make first small contributions.

Day 1–5

Set up Git/GitHub properly.

Configure git username, email, SSH keys.

Learn commands: clone, branch, commit, push, rebase, cherry-pick.

Read 2–3 Node.js repos’ structure (express, nestjs, strapi).

Explore issues labeled “good first issue”.

Day 6–10

Pick your first small issue (docs typo, README improvement, comments).

Fork → branch → fix → PR.

Repeat for 2–3 tiny PRs in different repos.

Day 11–15

Join Discord/Slack/Discussions for chosen projects.

Ask maintainers about areas needing help.

Post your first LinkedIn update:

“Made my first open-source contribution fixing docs in Express.js 🚀 Learning how the workflow works.”

Phase 2: Small Code Contributions (Day 16–30)

👉 Goal: Move from docs to small code fixes.

Day 16–20

Pick small bugs/typos in code (logging fixes, small refactor).

Learn how to run project tests locally.

Submit 1–2 code PRs.

Day 21–25

Contribute to test improvements (add missing test cases in Mocha/Jest repos).

Fix a simple Express middleware issue (logging, validation).

Share LinkedIn update:

“Wrote my first unit test contribution for an OSS project. Learned Jest testing conventions 🧪.”

Day 26–30

Make 3–4 PRs across different repos.

Keep them small but meaningful (bug fixes, small refactors, tests).

Add pinned repos on GitHub (your contributions + any personal project).

Phase 3: Real Feature Work (Day 31–45)

👉 Goal: Work on features and bigger PRs.

Day 31–35

Pick a medium issue (adding a helper function, improving API).

Comment: “I’d like to work on this. Can you guide me?”

Get feedback, make a PR.

Day 36–40

Contribute to NestJS or Strapi (bigger frameworks with many beginner-friendly issues).

Example: add validation in DTO, improve error message, add config options.

Write about it on LinkedIn:

“Contributed a new error-handling feature in NestJS 🚀 Learned how decorators are structured internally.”

Day 41–45

Keep at least 1 PR per week in active repos.

Engage in review discussions (review others’ PRs, ask questions).

Start thinking about your own OSS idea (e.g., logger, Redis wrapper, API boilerplate).

Phase 4: Your Own Project + Visibility (Day 46–60)

👉 Goal: Stand out by owning a project + making bigger contributions.

Day 46–50

Start your own mini Node.js open-source project:
Examples:

express-rate-limiter-middleware

simple-redis-cache-wrapper

node-api-boilerplate

Push to GitHub + publish on npm (optional).

Day 51–55

Document your project properly (README.md, usage examples).

Share on LinkedIn/GitHub Discussions:

“Released my first npm package for Express.js 🚀 — a lightweight rate limiter. Open to feedback!”

Day 56–60

Continue 1–2 PRs in popular repos (Express, Strapi, NestJS).

Actively engage with maintainers.

Add your project + contributions in GitHub profile README.

📊 After 60 Days You’ll Have:

✅ 8–12 PRs (docs + code + tests + features).
✅ At least 1 npm package / OSS project of your own.
✅ A GitHub profile with pinned repos + green graph.
✅ LinkedIn posts showing your OSS journey.
✅ Confidence to work on larger projects like Node.js core.
