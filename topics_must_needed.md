To crack any JavaScript interview, especially for frontend or full-stack roles, you should master both foundational concepts and advanced topics. Below is a structured list covering all essential areas:

üîπ 1. Core JavaScript (ES5 to ES2023)
Q.1) Data types and type coercion ?
ans : In javascript you have the mainly 7 primitives and 4 non-primitive data types:
   primitives:
    1) string
    2) number
    3) boolean
    4) BigInt
    5) Symbol
    6) null
    7) undefined

    Non-primitives
    1) Array
    2) object
    3) functions
    4) Dates

Q.2) Variable declarations: var, let, const ?
ans : let and const are the block scoped variables means the variables that are defined using let and const are accessible only within the block in which they defined
  var is the function scoped variabels means the variables that are defined using var are accessible only within the function this will occurs the duplicacy.

Q.3) Hoisting ?
ans : Hoisting is a technique in which the variables are auto declared at the top of the block but not initialization.

Q.4) Scope (global, function, block)?
ans : global scope is a scope in which the variables are accessible in all code of a file
     function scope is a scope in which the variables are accessible within the function only
     block scope is a scope in which the variables are accessible within the block only in which they declared

Q.5) Closures and lexical environment?
ans : Closures are the functions which remembers the variables of the outer functions even if the outer function completes its execution.
  lexical environment refers to the scope of variable in which it is accessible to use.

Q.6) Execution context & call stack ?
ans : Exection context has all the information related to the execution of the function
      first the global execution context is stored in the callstack which is executed at the end
      after that all the functions execution context is stored in LIFO format.

      call stack is responsible for the exexution of the tasks synchronously because it is using only a single thread
      call stack has two phases memory allocation and code execution.


Q.6) Temporal Dead Zone?
ans : let and const are declaration are hoisted but not initialized with undefined
     and if developer try to access this variable at this zone this will gives us reference error variable not initialized because this variable is in its temporal dead zone 

Q.7) this keyword and binding (call, apply, bind)?
ans : this keyword refers to the parent object.
     call,apply and bind are used to set the context of this for a function.
     call: invokes immediately and accepts the arguments seperately function.call(object,arguement1,argument2);
     apply: just like call but accepts the arguments as array function.apply(object, [argument1,argument2]);
     bind: saved the result for later use, accepts the arguments seperately 
       const result = function.bind(object,argument1,argument2);

Q.8) Strict mode ('use strict') ?
ans : in strict mode the 

Q.9) Destructuring (Arrays and Objects)?
ans : Arrays destructuring is used to assign the values  of the array to the variables on the fly.
     Objects destructuring is used to assign the properties of the objects to the variables on the fly.
      

Q.10) Spread/rest operators? 
ans : Spread operator is used to expand the values of the iterables
      Rest operator is used to collect the values of the iterables.

Q.11) Optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)?
ans : Optional chaining is used to shorter the if else syntax 
     according to the condtion execute the first block if true else executes the second block if false

Q.12) Short-circuiting (||, &&)?
ans : IN || comparison short circuits if the true value is found if not found any true then return the first value
      In && comparison short circuits if the false value is found if not found any false then return the last value.

Q.13) Loops (for, while, for...of, for...in)?
ans : for loop is used to iterate over the elements according the given condition.
     while loop is also used to iterate over the elements according to the given condition.
     for...of is used to iterate over the array till the length of the array.
     for...in is used to ierate over the iterables till the length.

Q.14) Object and Array methods?
ans :  object like : object.create, object.assign, object.entities, object.values, object.keys
      array like : array.push(), array.pop(), array.includes(), array.shift(), array.unshift()

Q.15) Higher-order functions?
ans : Higher order functions are the functions which takes another function as its argument or return another function or both.
