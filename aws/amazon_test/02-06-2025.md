B. AWS Direct Connect + IPsec VPN
C. AWS PrivateLink with VPC endpoints
D. AWS Transit Gateway with VPN attachments

Answer: B
✅ Explanation:

Direct Connect provides dedicated private connectivity (bypasses internet).

IPsec VPN adds encryption (though Direct Connect is private, encryption is still a requirement).

A uses public internet. C/D are for AWS-to-AWS or hybrid architectures.

# Question 32
Which TWO are security best practices for VPC design?
A. Use a single public subnet for all resources
B. Enable VPC Flow Logs for all subnets

C manages WAF rules. E investigates threats (not compliance).

# Question 38
Which load balancer should you use for TCP traffic with static IPs?

A. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
B. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
C. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
D. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

Answer: B
✅ Explanation:

NLB handles TCP/UDP traffic and supports static IPs.

ALB is L7 only. GWLB is for firewalls. CLB is legacy.

# Question 39
A multi-account environment needs cross-account access to an S3 bucket with:

Destination: 10.0.0.0/16 → Target: igw-12345
C.

Destination: ::/0 → Target: Local
D.

Destination: 192.168.0.0/16 → Target: vpce-abcde

Answer: A
✅ Explanation:

Private subnets route internet-bound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to a NAT Gateway.

B routes VPC traffic to internet gateway (wrong use case). C is IPv6 local traffic. D is for VPC endpoints.

# Question 61
A company wants to automate infrastructure updates using immutable deployments to reduce downtime. Which strategy should they use?

A. Blue/Green deployments with AWS Elastic Beanstalk
B. In-place rolling updates with AWS CloudFormation

Trusted Advisor recommends optimizations (cost, performance, security).

B is for compliance. D is for DB performance. E is for DDoS protection.

# Question 63
A serverless application needs to audit API usage and detect anomalies in real time. Which solution should they use?

A. Amazon CloudWatch Logs with metric filters
B. AWS CloudTrail + Amazon Athena
C. Amazon API Gateway Access Logging + Amazon OpenSearch
D. AWS X-Ray with anomaly detection

Answer: C
✅ Explanation:

API Gateway Access Logs capture detailed API usage data.

OpenSearch enables real-time analytics and anomaly detection.

A/B lack real-time anomaly detection. D is for tracing (not API auditing).

# Question 64
Which CI/CD pipeline design ensures fast rollback for failed deployments?

A. Single pipeline with manual approval gates
B. Canary deployments with AWS CodeDeploy
C. Immutable infrastructure with AWS CodePipeline
D. Blue/Green deployments with AWS Lambda aliases

Answer: B
✅ Explanation:

Canary deployments gradually shift traffic, allowing quick rollback if errors occur.

A is slow. C/D don’t inherently support gradual rollback.

# Question 65
A multi-region microservices architecture needs centralized observability. Which THREE services should they use?
A. Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights
B. AWS X-Ray
C. Amazon Managed Grafana
D. AWS Config
E. AWS Shield

Answer: A, B, C
✅ Explanation:

CloudWatch Logs Insights aggregates logs across regions.

X-Ray traces requests across microservices.

Managed Grafana visualizes metrics.

D is for compliance. E is for security.

# Question 66
Which TWO are Well-Architected best practices for reliability?
A. Use multiple Availability Zones
B. Implement chaos engineering
C. Over-provision capacity by 50%
D. Disable CloudWatch alarms to reduce costs

Answer: A, B
✅ Explanation:

Multi-AZ ensures fault tolerance.

Chaos engineering proactively tests failure scenarios.

C is wasteful. D compromises monitoring.

# Question 67
A company wants to automate security patching for EC2 instances without downtime. Which solution should they use?

A. AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager
B. Manual updates via SSH
C. AWS OpsWorks
D. AWS Lambda with custom scripts

Answer: A
✅ Explanation:

Patch Manager automates OS patching with maintenance windows.

B is manual. C is for Chef/Puppet. D is not designed for patching.

# Question 68
Which TWO strategies improve performance efficiency for a global web application?
A. Use Amazon CloudFront with edge caching
B. Deploy read replicas in each Region
C. Store all data in S3 Standard
D. Use larger EC2 instances in one Region

Answer: A, B
✅ Explanation:

CloudFront caches content closer to users.

Read replicas reduce latency for database queries.

C is not performance-optimized. D doesn’t address global latency.

# Question 69
Which AWS service helps automate incident response for operational issues?

A. AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager
B. Amazon GuardDuty
C. AWS Config
D. AWS Budgets

Answer: A
✅ Explanation:

Incident Manager automates response workflows (e.g., triggering runbooks).

B detects threats. C audits compliance. D monitors costs.

# Question 70
A machine learning workload needs scalable inference with low latency. Which solution should they use?

A. Amazon SageMaker real-time endpoints
B. AWS Batch
C. Amazon EMR
D. Amazon Comprehend

Answer: A
✅ Explanation:

SageMaker endpoints auto-scale for real-time inference.

B is for batch jobs. C is for big data. D is a pre-trained NLP service.

# Question 71
Which TWO are best practices for infrastructure as code (IaC)?
A. Use AWS CloudFormation templates
B. Store templates in Amazon S3 with versioning
C. Manually update stacks via console
D. Hardcode secrets in templates

Answer: A, B
✅ Explanation:

CloudFormation automates deployments.

S3 versioning tracks template changes.

C defeats IaC principles. D is a security risk.

# Question 72
A containerized application needs auto-scaling and multi-region deployment. Which solution is MOST scalable?

A. Amazon ECS with Fargate and Application Auto Scaling
B. Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2
C. AWS Lambda with container support
D. Amazon Lightsail

Answer: A
✅ Explanation:

ECS Fargate is serverless and scales automatically.

B requires manual scaling. C is for event-driven workloads. D is for simple apps.

# Question 73
Which TWO services help implement continuous improvement for security?
A. AWS Security Hub
B. Amazon Inspector
C. AWS Backup
D. Amazon QuickSight
