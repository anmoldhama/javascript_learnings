ðŸ”¹ Section 1: AWS Fundamentals
Q.1) What is AWS, and what are its primary services?
ans :AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers on-demand computing resources and services in a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Organizations use AWS to host websites, run applications, manage databases, store files, and much more.

EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers in the cloud.

ELB (Elastic Load Balancing): Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent block storage for EC2.

Lambda: Serverless compute service to run code in response to events.

CloudWatch: Monitoring and logging service.

IAM (Identity and Access Management): User and permissions management.

S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage service.

ASG (Auto Scaling Group): Automatically adjusts EC2 instances based on demand.



Q.2) Explain the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.
ans : The AWS Shared Responsibility Model outlines who is responsible for what in the cloud environment:

AWS (Provider) is responsible for:

The security "of" the cloud (hardware, software, networking, facilities).

Physical infrastructure and global network.

Customer is responsible for:

Security "in" the cloud (data, identity, applications).

Configuring security groups, managing IAM users, encrypting data, etc.

Example:

AWS secures the S3 infrastructure.

You (customer) secure the data stored in your S3 bucket via permissions.

Q.3) What are AWS Regions and Availability Zones?
ans : Region: A geographic area (e.g., US-East-1, ap-south-1) containing multiple data centers.

Availability Zone (AZ): A physically isolated data center in a region with its own power, cooling, and networking.

Each Region has 2 or more AZs. Services like EC2 and RDS can span AZs for high availability and fault tolerance.

Q.4) Define and differentiate IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with AWS examples.
ans : | Model                                  | Description                                                  | AWS Example                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |

OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux)

Application server

Applications

You use an AMI to launch EC2 instances. You can also create custom AMIs to include your specific software stack.

Q.6) What is the AWS Free Tier, and what does it include?
ans: The AWS Free Tier allows new users to explore AWS services for free (for 12 months).

Reliability â€“ Recovery, availability, failure handling.

Performance Efficiency â€“ Right resources for workload, scaling.

Cost Optimization â€“ Avoid waste, measure spending.

Q.9) How does AWS pricing work?
ans : AWS uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model:

Per-second or per-hour billing (depending on service).

Tiered pricing for data transfer and storage.

Savings Plans and Reserved Instances offer discounts for long-term commitments.

Free Tier for new users.

You only pay for what you consume, with no upfront cost or long-term commitment (unless you opt in).

Q.10) What are AWS Service Limits?
ans : AWS imposes default service limits (quotas) to protect users from accidental overuse and to manage resources.

Examples:

Number of EC2 instances per region.

Number of VPCs per region.

Lambda concurrency limits.

Limits can be soft (adjustable) or hard (fixed). You can request limit increases via AWS Support.

ðŸ”¹ Section 2: Compute Services
