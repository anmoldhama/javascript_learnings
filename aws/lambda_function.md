Q) Basic / Fundamental AWS Lambda Questions
Q) What is AWS Lambda?
ans : Lambda is a serverless architecture which takes care of all the necessary requirements of a script to execute
      you can trigger using multiple options like alexa, api gateway, cloudwatch
      The cloud will takes care of the resources scaling up and down
      But this will have some latency as compares to server architecutre like EC2
      You can upload a zip, write from scratch, use docker image

      AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

It automatically scales with demand and supports event-driven architecture (e.g., via API Gateway, CloudWatch, S3, DynamoDB, Alexa, etc.).

You pay only for the compute time your code uses.

Compared to EC2, Lambda can have cold starts (initial latency), but it‚Äôs highly cost-efficient for lightweight or intermittent workloads.

Q) How does AWS Lambda pricing work?
ans : works on the basis of per request.
      You are billed based on:

Number of requests (First 1M/month free)

Duration (time your code runs, rounded to the nearest millisecond)

Memory allocated

Optionally, there‚Äôs provisioned concurrency pricing for consistent latency needs.

Q) What are the main benefits of using AWS Lambda?
ans : Auto scale/down, cloud takes care of resources, cost-efficient‚Ä¶

‚úÖ Good answer ‚Äî you might also mention:

Micro-billing (you only pay for what you use)

No server maintenance

Integration with many AWS services

Built-in fault tolerance



Q) Which programming languages are supported by AWS Lambda?
ans : Nodejs, java,Go, Python etc

Q) What is the default timeout for a Lambda function? Can you change it?
ans : The default timeout for an AWS Lambda function is 3 seconds.

Yes, you can change it ‚Äî the maximum allowed timeout is 15 minutes (900 seconds).

You can configure this during:

Function creation via the AWS Console

Using the AWS CLI:

aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name myFunction --timeout 120

In serverless.yml or similar if using frameworks.

Q) What is the maximum execution timeout limit for a Lambda function?
ans : The maximum timeout limit is 15 minutes (900 seconds).

Use longer timeouts only when absolutely necessary ‚Äî for short tasks, it's better to keep timeouts small to avoid cold start delays and costs.

Q) What is a cold start in AWS Lambda?
ans : A cold start happens when AWS initializes a new container to run your Lambda function.

It includes:

Booting the runtime

Downloading your code

Initializing dependencies

This only happens when:

The function is invoked for the first time

After periods of inactivity

When the Lambda scales horizontally

Cold starts cause extra latency (100ms to 1+ sec).

Tip to reduce cold starts:

Use provisioned concurrency

Minimize initialization logic in the global scope

Q) What is the maximum memory you can allocate to a Lambda function?
ans : The memory for a Lambda function can be set from 128 MB to 10,240 MB (10 GB) in 1 MB increments.

More memory means:

More CPU and network throughput

Faster execution (in many cases)

Q) How do you deploy a Lambda function?
ans : You can deploy a Lambda function in multiple ways:

AWS Console:

Create a new Lambda

Write or paste code inline or upload a ZIP

AWS CLI:

aws lambda create-function --function-name myFunc \
  --runtime nodejs20.x \
  --role <execution-role-arn> \
  --handler index.handler \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Using tools like:

Serverless Framework

AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)

Terraform

CloudFormation

CI/CD Pipeline:

Integrate with GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, etc.

Q) What are AWS Lambda execution roles?
ans : An execution role is an IAM role that a Lambda function assumes at runtime.

It defines what AWS services/resources your Lambda can access.

Example: If your Lambda reads from S3 and writes to DynamoDB, you must:

Attach a role with s3:GetObject and dynamodb:PutItem permissions.

Creating an execution role:

Go to IAM > Roles

Create a new role with AWS Lambda as the trusted entity

Attach required permissions

Assign this role to the Lambda

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "dynamodb:PutItem"],
  "Resource": "*"
}

Q) üü° Intermediate AWS Lambda Questions
Q) What are Lambda triggers? Name some AWS services that can trigger a Lambda function.
ans : api gateway
      s3
      cloudwatch
      dynamodb


Q) How does AWS Lambda handle scaling with high-concurrency workloads?
ans : 

AWS Lambda is designed to scale automatically ‚Äî meaning it can handle thousands of concurrent executions without any manual intervention.

‚öôÔ∏è How the Scaling Works Internally
Event Triggers Start Execution

Each time an event is received (e.g., API call, S3 upload, SNS message), AWS Lambda:

Allocates an instance of your function.

Executes it with the event payload.

Automatic Scaling

If multiple events arrive simultaneously, AWS automatically creates multiple instances (containers) of your Lambda function to process them in parallel.

Burst Concurrency Limits

Initially, Lambda can scale up quickly up to 3000 concurrent executions in most regions.

After that, scaling continues gradually based on demand and region-specific quotas.

Soft Limit (Concurrency Limit)

By default, there is a regional soft concurrency limit (e.g., 1000 concurrent executions).

You can request an increase via AWS Support.

Reserved Concurrency

You can allocate reserved concurrency for critical functions to ensure they always have capacity ‚Äî this also caps them to avoid overload.

Provisioned Concurrency (Cold Start Mitigation)

For predictable workloads needing low latency, provisioned concurrency pre-warms environments ‚Äî helping avoid cold starts and improve responsiveness at scale.



Q) What‚Äôs the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation in Lambda?
ans :

| Feature                       | **Synchronous**                                         | **Asynchronous**                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who waits for the result?** | Caller waits for the result (blocking)                  | Caller doesn't wait (non-blocking)                |
| **Invocation behavior**       | Immediate execution, returns result directly            | Queued by Lambda, executed later                  |
| **Example triggers**          | API Gateway, ALB, SDK (`invoke` with `RequestResponse`) | S3, SNS, CloudWatch Events                        |
| **Error handling**            | Caller handles errors                                   | Lambda retries automatically (2 times by default) |
| **Retry logic**               | Handled by the caller                                   | Lambda retries with exponential backoff           |
| **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**   | Not applicable                                          | Can be configured to capture failed events        |
| **Maximum timeout**           | 15 minutes                                              | 15 minutes                                        |
| **Use cases**                 | APIs, real-time processing                              | Event-driven, fire-and-forget workflows           |



Q) How can you pass parameters to a Lambda function?
ans :
1. Via Event Object (Standard Method)
The most common way is by passing an event object. This works for:

AWS SDK

AWS CLI

Lambda Triggers (API Gateway, S3, SNS, etc.)

üßæ Example (Node.js Lambda):



exports.handler = async (event) => {
  console.log(event); // contains the parameters
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello", input: event }),
  };
};
üì¶ When invoking via AWS SDK:



const params = {
  FunctionName: "myLambdaFunction",
  Payload: JSON.stringify({ userId: 123, action: "getUser" })
};

lambda.invoke(params, function(err, data) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
  else console.log(data);
});
2. Query Parameters / Path Parameters (API Gateway)
If Lambda is triggered by API Gateway, you can pass:

Path parameters (e.g., /users/{id})

Query strings (e.g., ?type=admin)

Request body (JSON)

üîç In the Lambda function:



exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const userId = event.pathParameters.id;
  const type = event.queryStringParameters.type;
  const body = JSON.parse(event.body);
};
3. Environment Variables
For config-style static parameters (not per-invocation), use Lambda environment variables.

üì¶ Example:



process.env.DB_HOST; // e.g., "mydb.cluster.amazonaws.com"
You set them in:

AWS Console

AWS CLI (--environment)

Infrastructure as Code (e.g., CDK, CloudFormation)

4. Context Object Parameters
AWS provides a context object automatically:



exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  console.log(context.functionName);
  console.log(context.memoryLimitInMB);
};
These aren't custom parameters but useful metadata.

5. Lambda Destinations / EventBridge Inputs
For event-driven or decoupled architectures (e.g., with Step Functions, SQS, or EventBridge), you can pass input via their respective event payloads.



Q) How do you handle error handling and retries in AWS Lambda?
ans :
üîÅ 1. Synchronous Invocation (e.g., API Gateway, SDK calls)
The caller receives the error directly (immediate feedback).

No automatic retry by Lambda.

You must handle retries on the client side or using custom logic.

üì¶ Example error:



{
  "FunctionError": "Handled",
  "Payload": "... stack trace or error message ..."
}
‚úÖ How to handle:

Try-catch in client code.

Use retry mechanisms (e.g., exponential backoff, circuit breaker).

Monitor using CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray.

üîÅ 2. Asynchronous Invocation (e.g., S3, SNS, EventBridge)
Lambda automatically retries the function 2 more times (total of 3 attempts) on failure.

Retry uses exponential backoff.

If still failing, Lambda can:

Send to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) (SQS or SNS).

Or trigger a Failure Destination (e.g., another Lambda or EventBridge rule).

‚úÖ How to handle:

Use try-catch inside the Lambda code.

Return proper status codes or throw errors.

Configure DLQ or Lambda Destinations.

üì¶ Configure DLQ (CLI):



aws lambda update-function-configuration \
--function-name myLambda \
--dead-letter-config TargetArn=arn:aws:sqs:region:account-id:queue-name
üîÅ 3. Stream-Based Invocation (e.g., Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams)
Lambda keeps retrying the batch until it succeeds or the data expires (7 days max).

If the batch keeps failing:

You can split batches with Bisecting on error.

Or send failures to SQS DLQ.

‚úÖ How to handle:

Ensure idempotency (so retries don't cause duplicates).

Log and monitor partial failures.

Use checkpointing with proper error boundaries.

üîÅ 4. Poll-Based Invocation (e.g., SQS, MQ)
Lambda polls the queue and automatically retries on failure until the visibility timeout expires.

After maxReceiveCount, the message is sent to a DLQ (configured in the queue, not Lambda).

üî• Inside Your Lambda Function
Use try-catch blocks and handle known failure conditions gracefully:



exports.handler = async (event) => {
  try {
    // main logic
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error occurred:", err);
    throw new Error("Function failed"); // For Lambda to recognize as failure
  }
};


Q) What are environment variables in AWS Lambda? How do you use them?
ans : 
Environment variables are:

Available to your function at runtime.

Set per Lambda version or alias.

Useful for things like:

Database connection strings

API keys

Feature toggles

Secrets (use encrypted values via KMS)

üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Environment Variables
üß≠ 1. AWS Console
Go to your Lambda function ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Environment variables ‚Üí Add/Edit.

üß± 2. AWS CLI


aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name myLambda \
  --environment "Variables={ENV_NAME=production,DB_URL=mydb.example.com}"
‚öôÔ∏è 3. Infrastructure as Code
CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform, or Serverless Framework support defining environment variables.


Q) Can a Lambda function call another Lambda function?
ans :
A Lambda function can call another Lambda function, and this is a common pattern in serverless architectures ‚Äî especially in microservices, modular workflows, and Step Functions.

üîß How Can a Lambda Call Another Lambda?
There are two primary methods:

1. Using AWS SDK (Direct Invocation)
The calling Lambda uses the AWS SDK (AWS.Lambda) to invoke another Lambda by name or ARN.

üìå Node.js Example:



const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const lambda = new AWS.Lambda();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const params = {
    FunctionName: "otherLambdaFunctionName",
    InvocationType: "RequestResponse", // or "Event" for async
    Payload: JSON.stringify({ key: "value" })
  };

  const response = await lambda.invoke(params).promise();
  return JSON.parse(response.Payload);
};
2. Via Event Triggers (Decoupled)
Instead of invoking directly, you can have Lambda A emit an event (to SQS, SNS, EventBridge, etc.), and Lambda B is triggered based on that event.

üîÅ Useful for asynchronous, decoupled workflows:

Lambda A publishes to SNS ‚Üí triggers Lambda B

Lambda A sends message to SQS ‚Üí triggers Lambda B

Lambda A writes to DynamoDB ‚Üí DynamoDB Streams trigger Lambda B

‚úÖ Invocation Types
Invocation Type	Value	Behavior
Synchronous	"RequestResponse"	Caller waits for the response
Asynchronous	"Event"	Caller does not wait; retry & DLQ apply

üõ°Ô∏è IAM Permission Requirement
The calling Lambda needs lambda:InvokeFunction permission on the target Lambda.

üìú IAM Policy Example:



{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:otherLambda"
}


Q) What is the use of Layers in Lambda functions?
ans :  
A Layer is a ZIP archive that contains code (e.g., libraries, custom runtimes, or configuration files) which is injected into the Lambda execution environment.

Layers allow you to:

Share common code between multiple functions

Reduce deployment package size

Promote code reuse

Keep business logic separate from dependencies

üß† Why Use Lambda Layers?
Use Case	Example
Share common libraries	axios, lodash, pandas, requests
Use custom binaries or tools	FFmpeg, Puppeteer, wkhtmltopdf
Share utility/helper functions	Logging, monitoring, config parsers
Manage language runtimes	Custom Python/Node versions
Environment configuration	Shared .env loaders or constants

üõ†Ô∏è How Layers Work
Layers are mounted at the path:

/opt/ in the Lambda runtime.

You can include up to 5 layers per function.

At runtime, the contents of the layer are merged with your function's /var/task.

üí° Example: Using a Layer (Node.js)
If your layer contains a nodejs/node_modules folder with libraries:



// Your Lambda function
const axios = require('axios'); // from the layer
‚úÖ Make sure the layer has structure:



nodejs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ axios/
üìÅ How to Create a Layer
Create ZIP archive with dependencies in the correct structure.

Upload Layer using AWS Console, CLI, or IaC.

üì¶ CLI Example:



zip -r layer.zip nodejs/
aws lambda publish-layer-version \
  --layer-name my-layer \
  --zip-file fileb://layer.zip \
  --compatible-runtimes nodejs18.x


Attach to Lambda function:



aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name myFunction \
  --layers arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:layer:my-layer:1

Q) How do you monitor a Lambda function?
ans : 
1. Amazon CloudWatch
a) Logs
Every Lambda function automatically generates CloudWatch Logs.

You can console.log() or use structured logging.

Logs help with debugging and visibility.

üìå Example (Node.js):



console.log("Processing event:", JSON.stringify(event));
b) Metrics
AWS provides built-in metrics like:

Metric Name	Description
Invocations	Number of times function is called
Duration	Execution time of function (ms)
Errors	Count of function errors
Throttles	When requests exceed concurrency
IteratorAge	For stream-based triggers (e.g., Kinesis, DynamoDB)
ConcurrentExecutions	Number of concurrent instances

‚úÖ View these in the CloudWatch ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí Lambda namespace.

c) Alarms
Set alarms (e.g., if errors > 5 in 5 minutes).

Trigger notifications using Amazon SNS or OpsGenie.

2. AWS X-Ray (Distributed Tracing)
Helps trace the end-to-end flow of requests.

Tracks latency and bottlenecks across services (e.g., Lambda ‚Üí DynamoDB ‚Üí S3).

Shows function cold starts, segments, and external service calls.

üìå Enable by adding this to your function config or using SDK.

3. CloudWatch Insights (Advanced Logs Queries)
Write custom queries like:



fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /Error/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
Great for debugging or log analysis at scale.

4. Third-Party Monitoring Tools (Optional)
If you need more observability:

Datadog

New Relic

Dynatrace

Sentry

Epsagon (now part of Cisco)

These offer deeper analytics, tracing, alerting, and visualization.

Q) How can you secure sensitive data (like API keys) in a Lambda function?
ans :
1. Use Environment Variables (with Encryption)
Store API keys in Lambda environment variables.

Use KMS encryption (at rest) automatically provided by AWS.

Optionally, use your own KMS key (CMK) for more control.

üìå Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name myFunction \
  --environment Variables="{API_KEY=your_api_key_here}"
Inside your code:



const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
‚úÖ Use IAM permissions to restrict who can read environment variables via AWS Console/API.

2. AWS Secrets Manager ‚úÖ (Recommended)
Store secrets like DB passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens securely.

Automatically encrypts secrets with KMS.

Built-in rotation, versioning, and access control.

üìå Example:



const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager();

const secret = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({ SecretId: 'MySecret' }).promise();
const apiKey = JSON.parse(secret.SecretString).apiKey;
üîê Attach a fine-grained IAM policy so only authorized Lambdas can access this secret.

3. AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store
Store parameters as SecureString (encrypted with KMS).

Less expensive than Secrets Manager.

Good for configuration and secrets.

üìå Example:



const ssm = new AWS.SSM();

const param = await ssm.getParameter({
  Name: '/prod/api/key',
  WithDecryption: true
}).promise();

const apiKey = param.Parameter.Value;
4. Use IAM Roles and Policies
Never hardcode secrets in your code or layers.

Use Lambda execution roles with fine-grained access.

Combine with Secrets Manager or SSM to fetch secrets securely at runtime.

5. VPC + Security Groups (if accessing DBs or APIs internally)
Use VPC networking to restrict outbound/inbound access.

Use private subnets + NAT gateway to control traffic.

üö´ Avoid:
‚ùå Hardcoding secrets in code

‚ùå Uploading secrets via ZIP deployment

‚ùå Logging sensitive data with console.log()
