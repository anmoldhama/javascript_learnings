Core VPC Concepts (Fundamentals)
Q) What is a VPC?
ans : A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an isolated virtual network in AWS where you can launch resources (EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc.). It controls:

Inbound/Outbound traffic (via Security Groups & NACLs)

IP addressing (via CIDR blocks)

Subnet segmentation (public/private)

How It Differs from Traditional Networking
Traditional Networking	                    AWS VPC
Physical hardware (routers, switches)	 Software-defined networking
Manual IP management	                 Automated CIDR allocation
Limited scalability	                     On-demand scaling
Complex VPN setups	                     Built-in VPN/Direct Connect


Core Components : 
Subnets (Public/Private)

Route Tables (Direct traffic between subnets)

Internet Gateway (IGW) (Connects to the public internet)

NAT Gateway/Instance (Private subnet internet access)

Security Groups (SGs) & NACLs (Firewall rules)


Explain how it differs from traditional networking and its core components (subnets, route tables, etc.).

Q.2) Describe the difference between:

Public vs. Private Subnets
  Public Subnet	                                        Private Subnet
Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW)	        No direct internet access
Hosts public-facing services (e.g., web servers)	Hosts databases, internal apps
Uses public IPs	                                    Uses private IPs (NAT for outbound)


NAT Gateway vs. NAT Instance
  NAT Gateway	                             NAT Instance
Managed by AWS (no maintenance)	            Self-managed EC2 instance
Scales automatically	                    Manual scaling required
No security group needed	                Requires security group
Higher bandwidth (up to 45 Gbps)	        Limited by instance type


Internet Gateway (IGW) vs. Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
Internet Gateway (IGW)	                              Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
Connects VPC to the public internet	                Connects VPC to on-premises networks (VPN/Direct 
                                                      Connect)
Used for public subnets	                            Used for hybrid cloud setups
Supports IPv4/IPv6	                                Typically IPv4 only 

Q.3) How does AWS ensure VPC isolation?
ans : Account-level isolation: Each VPC is confined to one AWS account.

Security Groups (SGs): Instance-level firewall (stateful → tracks connections).

Network ACLs (NACLs): Subnet-level firewall (stateless → no connection tracking).

Discuss account-level isolation, security groups, and NACLs.

Q.4) What is a CIDR block?
ans : A CIDR block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines an IP range for a VPC/subnet.
    range  : 2^32-prefic  - 2;
How would you calculate subnet sizes (e.g., /24 vs. /28)?

Q.5) Explain VPC Flow Logs:
ans : Flow Logs capture metadata about IP traffic in a VPC.
Data Captured:
Source/destination IPs

Ports & protocols

Packet/byte counts

Timestamps

What data do they capture? How would you analyze them for security threats?

VPC Design & Architecture (Intermediate)
Q.6) How would you design a VPC for:

A 3-tier web app (public, private, DB tiers)?

A hybrid cloud (AWS + on-premises)?

When would you use these?

VPC Peering vs. Transit Gateway

AWS PrivateLink vs. VPC Endpoints (Gateway/Interface)

How do you connect multiple VPCs across regions/accounts?

Discuss Transit Gateway, inter-region peering, and RAM (Resource Access Manager).

What is a VPC endpoint?

Compare S3 Gateway Endpoint vs. Interface Endpoints (e.g., for DynamoDB).

How would you restrict S3 access to only a specific VPC?

Use VPC Endpoint Policies + S3 Bucket Policies.

Security & Compliance (Advanced)
How would you implement:

Network segmentation for PCI compliance?

Zero-trust networking within a VPC?

What are NACLs vs. Security Groups?

Compare stateless (NACL) vs. stateful (SG) behavior with examples.

How do you block these in a VPC?

Inbound SSH/RDP from the internet

Outbound traffic to specific IP ranges

Explain VPC security best practices:

Least privilege for SGs, NACLs for subnet-level controls, flow logs for auditing.

How would you detect and mitigate a DDoS attack in a VPC?

Use AWS Shield + WAF + CloudFront + Auto Scaling.

Connectivity & Hybrid Cloud (DevOps Focus)
Compare these for hybrid connectivity:

AWS Direct Connect vs. Site-to-Site VPN

VPN over Direct Connect vs. public internet

How do you troubleshoot a VPN connection failure?

Check CloudWatch logs, VPN tunnel status, routing tables, and BGP configs.

What is AWS Transit Gateway?

When would you use it over VPC peering?

How do you route traffic between VPCs and on-premises?

Discuss route tables, VGW, and BGP propagation.

Explain VPC sharing (AWS RAM):

How do you isolate resources in a shared VPC?

Performance & Scalability
How do you optimize VPC performance for:

High-throughput applications (e.g., data lakes)?

Low-latency financial trading systems?

What is Jumbo Frames?

How would you enable it in a VPC?

How do you scale NAT Gateways?

Discuss AZ-distributed architecture and monitoring.

What are VPC quotas?

How would you request increases (e.g., for more subnets or Elastic IPs)?

How do you design for multi-region HA?

Use Global Accelerator, multi-region VPCs, and DNS failover.

Troubleshooting Scenarios (Practical)
An EC2 instance in a private subnet can’t reach the internet. Debug step-by-step.

Check NAT Gateway/Instance, route tables, NACLs, SGs, and OS-level firewalls.

A Lambda function with VPC access times out. What’s wrong?

Missing NAT Gateway, insufficient ENI capacity, or subnet misconfiguration.

VPC peering connection is active, but traffic isn’t flowing. Why?

Check route tables (both VPCs), NACLs, and overlapping CIDR blocks.

Users report slow S3 access from a VPC. Diagnose.

Use VPC Endpoints, enable S3 Transfer Acceleration, or check network ACLs.

How do you monitor VPC bandwidth usage?

Use CloudWatch metrics (e.g., NetworkIn/Out) or third-party tools like VPC Flow Logs + Athena.

Advanced DevOps Scenarios
How would you automate VPC provisioning?

Terraform (AWS Provider) or AWS CDK with modular designs.

Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for:

A VPC with public/private subnets across 3 AZs.

A hub-and-spoke network with Transit Gateway.

How do you enforce VPC compliance via DevOps?

AWS Config rules + automated remediation (e.g., delete non-compliant SGs).

What is AWS Network Firewall?

How does it integrate with VPC Flow Logs and WAF?

Design a CI/CD pipeline that deploys to a private subnet:

Use CodeBuild in a VPC, private API Gateway, or SSM Session Manager.

Bonus: Real-World Case Studies
How would you migrate an on-premises network to AWS VPC?

Discuss AWS VPN/Direct Connect, phased cutover, and testing.

Design a VPC for a microservices architecture:

Use private subnets, Service Discovery, and VPC endpoints for AWS services.

How do you cost-optimize a VPC?

Delete unused NAT Gateways, consolidate VPCs, and use Shared VPCs.

What happens when you hit VPC limits?

Example: Running out of Elastic IPs or subnets per AZ.

Explain a VPC-related outage you resolved.

Example: Misconfigured NACL blocking critical traffic.
