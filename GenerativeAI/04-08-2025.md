etflix Recommendation Engine – Key Points
1. Data Sources
User behavior: watch history, ratings, search queries, watch time.

Content metadata: title, genre, cast, description, release year.

Contextual info: time of day, device type, location.

Popularity metrics: trending shows globally or regionally.

2. Embedding Generation
Purpose: Convert shows/users into numerical vectors for similarity search.

Methods:

Content-based: Use NLP embedding models (BERT, OpenAI) on metadata & synopsis.

Collaborative filtering: Matrix factorization / neural embeddings from user–item watch patterns.

Output: Fixed-length vectors like [0.98, 0.11, 0.34, ...].

3. Vector Storage
Store embeddings in Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS).

Structure:

{
  "id": "show_123",
  "title": "Money Heist",
  "vector": [0.98, 0.11, 0.34, 0.77, ...],
  "metadata": { "genre": "Crime", "year": 2017 }
}
No similarity calculations done yet — only store vectors + metadata.

4. Retrieval (Similarity Search)
Trigger: User watches "Money Heist".

Retrieve "Money Heist" vector.

Query vector DB: "Find top N most similar shows using cosine similarity".

Vector DB performs Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.

Returns similar shows: "Lupin", "Prison Break", "Kaleidoscope".

5. Personalization Layer
Filter results based on:

User’s disliked genres.

Shows already watched.

Age rating restrictions.

Re-rank results using a hybrid model combining:

Similarity score (vector match)

Popularity score (trending factor)

Personalized preference weight.

6. Special Categories
Similar Users: Store user embeddings; recommend shows popular among vector-nearby users.

Trending Shows: Track watch count velocity; store in fast key–value store (Redis) for quick retrieval.

New Releases: Filter metadata by release date.

7. Matching Example
"Money Heist": [0.98, 0.11, 0.34, 0.77, 0.56, ...]

"Lupin": [0.95, 0.12, 0.33, 0.78, 0.57, ...]

Cosine similarity ≈ 0.999 → highly related → recommend.(calculate using the cosine formula)
