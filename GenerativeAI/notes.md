Q.1) What is Generative AI ?
 ans : Generative AI is a subset of Artificial Intelligence which creates new content on the basis of finding the patterns from the input using the large data models.

# Generative AI is mostly powered by deep learning models, especially:

LLMs (Large Language Models) ‚Üí for text/code

Diffusion Models ‚Üí for images (e.g., DALL¬∑E, Stable Diffusion)

Transformers ‚Üí the architecture behind both text and vision models

Q.3) How Does It Work?
Generative AI works through two key stages:

1. Training (on massive datasets)
Feeds models tons of data (e.g., books, images, audio)

Learns patterns, context, associations

Creates "weights" and "embeddings" to encode understanding

2. Generation (Inference)
Takes a prompt or input

Predicts the next token/pixel/frame/sound

Samples from a probability distribution to produce creative output

Q.8) Difference between GPT, BERT, DALL¬∑E, Stable Diffusion, etc ?
ans :

GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer:

GPT, developed by OpenAI, is designed as an autoregressive model that predicts the next word in a sentence given all the previous words. It is fundamentally generative, which means it can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input it receives.

Here are some key features of GPT:

Autoregressive Nature: GPT is trained to predict the next word sequentially, making it highly effective for tasks that involve generating text, like content creation, story generation, and language translation.
Unidirectional Context: GPT only considers the previous words in the input for predictions, not what follows. This unidirectional approach is simpler but limits its effectiveness in understanding the full context of the input.
Fine-tuning on Task-Specific Datasets: After pre-training on a large corpus of text, GPT can be fine-tuned for specific tasks by training further on task-specific datasets.



BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers:

BERT, developed by researchers at Google, contrasts with GPT in that it is designed to derive deep bidirectional context from text by processing words in relation to all the other words in a sentence (rather than just the words that precede them). Here are the hallmarks of BERT:

Bidirectional Context: BERT‚Äôs major innovation is its mechanism of "masked language modeling" (MLM), where some words are randomly masked, and the objective is to predict these masked words based on both left and right context, thus providing a deeper understanding of language structure and usage.
Non-Generative: Unlike GPT, BERT is not used for generating text but for tasks that require understanding the relationships and representations within text, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and language inference.
Fine-tuning for Downstream Tasks: Similar to GPT, BERT is also fine-tuned from its pre-trained state on specific NLP tasks, though it generally requires fewer epochs of training due to its robust initial understanding of language context.

Applications and Performance :

The choice between GPT and BERT often depends on the specific requirements of the application:

GPT excels in tasks that require text generation. Its autoregressive feature makes it ideal for applications where the generation of coherent and contextually appropriate text is crucial.
BERT is superior for tasks that require understanding the context and nuances of language, making it suitable for NLP tasks like named entity recognition (NER), question answering, and language understanding.

#  GPT, BERT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion are all powerful AI models, but they serve different purposes.
#  GPT is primarily a text generation model, excelling at tasks like writing stories or having conversations. 
#  BERT is designed for understanding language and is used for tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. 
#  DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are image generation models; DALL-E is known for its ability to understand complex prompts and create detailed images, while Stable Diffusion is praised for its flexibility and control over the image generation process


Q.9)  Explain ethical concerns of Generative AI (bias,hallucination, IP) ?
ans :

* Bias in GenAI means the model generates outputs that reflect or amplify harmful stereotypes, discriminate, or unfairly favor certain groups, usually as a result of biased training data.
* Hallucination refers to when a GenAI model (like GPT) confidently generates false or misleading information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect.
* Intellectual Property means Generative AI can reproduce copyrighted material, sometimes very closely, raising legal concerns around infringement, plagiarism, and ownership.
