# Scenario based questions


 1‚Äì10: CRUD & Querying
You have a collection with millions of documents. A query using .find({ status: "active" }) is slow. How do you optimize it?

You need to fetch users who signed up within the last 24 hours. How would you query for this efficiently?

You're getting duplicate user records after running an update. What might be the issue?

You want to increment a field viewCount every time a document is read. How would you do this atomically?
