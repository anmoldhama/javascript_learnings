üî∞ Basic Level (1‚Äì30): Fundamentals and CRUD
Q1) What is MongoDB?
Mongodb is a NoSQL database have flexible schema, and stores data in BSON format, have collections and documents.
Follows the BASE properties.

Q2) How is MongoDB different from relational databases?
ans : Have the flexible schema not have the constraints like primary key and foreighn key
     Follow BASE in place of ACID

Q3) What is a document in MongoDB?
ans :  document is BSON format record,that may contain nested documents/arrays.

Q4) What is a collection in MongoDB?
ans : collection is a set of records like a table.

Q5) What is BSON in MongoDB?
ans : BSON is a Binary JSON format which allows to fast retrieval and insertion of data.

Q6) How do you create a database in MongoDB?
ans : use database_name in Mongo shell,Mongo creates DB when data is inserted.
      

Q7) How do you insert a document into a collection?
ans : db.collection_name.InsertOne({name: "anmol"});

Q8) How do you retrieve all documents from a collection?
ans : db.collection_name.find();

Q9) What is the difference between insertOne() and insertMany()?
ans : insertOne() insert the single record
      insertMany() insert the multiple records.
     

Q10) How do you update a document in MongoDB?
ans : use db.collection_name.updateOne(where :{name : "anmol"},{$set:{age: 25}});

Q11) What is the difference between updateOne() and updateMany()?
ans : updateOne() is used to update only single record
      updateMany() is used to update multiple records

Q12) How do you delete a document from a collection?
ans : use db.collection_name.deleteMany({age: 25});

Q13) What is the use of _id in MongoDB?
ans : it is a unique key for every record it is by default indexed and created.

Q14) How do you query for documents that match a specific condition?
ans : db.collection_name.find({age: 25});

Q15) How do you use comparison operators like $gt, $lt, $eq, etc.?
ans : db.collection_name.find({
       age : { $gt : 20}
});

Q16) What is a projection in MongoDB queries?
ans : projection gives you only the required values from the query not the complete data.

Q17) How do you limit and sort results in a query?
ans : use sort().limit();

Q18) What does the findOne() method do?
ans : it is used to find single matched record.

Q19) How do you count documents in a collection?
ans : Use .countDocuments() or .estimatedDocumentCount()

ans : find is used to find all the records with the matching filter
      aggregate is used for staging the records 
      like lookups, groups, projections etc

Q21) What is an index in MongoDB?
ans : index is technique using which we can retreive the data faster
      indexes are stored as a value and address of the original record
      and when we query the value the index direct point out to that record in main db.

Q22) How do you create an index?
ans : use db.collection_name.createIndex({fieldName: order});

Q23) What is a compound index?
ans : compound index is a indexing with using more than one fields.

ans : unique index is a index which is unque for a record like _id.

Q25) What is the explain() method used for?
ans : explain() method gives you the details of the query.

Q26) What is a capped collection?
ans : Capped collection = fixed-size collection that overwrites old documents when full. Use capped: true while creating.

Q27) What are embedded documents?
ans : embedded documents means that the documents are denormalized into nested objects and arrays.
     This will gives us the faster retreival.

Q28) What are referenced documents?
ans : Reference documents means that the data normalized into multiple collections using the references
      This will gives us the guarantee of no redundency.

Q29) How do you drop a collection or database?
ans : Drop collection: db.collection.drop(). Drop DB: db.dropDatabase()

ans : Schema design is handled dynamically but can be enforced via schema validation or Mongoose schemas in Node.js

Q33) When would you use embedding vs. referencing in schema design?
ans : Use embedding for tightly coupled data, referencing for large or shared datasets.

Q34) What is the aggregation framework?
ans : aggregation framework is used to query multi stages data example match,lookup, group, projection,etc.

Q35) What is a pipeline stage in aggregation?
ans : A stage in a pipeline transforms data (e.g., $match, $group, $project).

Q36) What does the $match stage do in aggregation?
ans : it will filter the records according to the condition given.

Q37) How does $group work in aggregation?
ans : it group the records according to the given group column

ans : 
Use the $text operator:
db.collection.find({ $text: { $search: "keyword" } })


Q44) What is the difference between save() and insert()?
ans : insert() adds a new document.

save() will insert a document if _id doesn't exist, otherwise it replaces the document with the same _id.


Q45) What is the difference between update() and replaceOne()?
ans : update() updates part of the document (can use $set, $inc, etc.).
    replaceOne() replaces the entire document except _id.

    db.collection.update({ _id: 1 }, { $set: { name: "John" } });
    db.collection.replaceOne({ _id: 1 }, { name: "John", age: 30 });


Q46) What are transactions in MongoDB?

Q53) What is Read Preference in MongoDB?
ans : Read preference given to the replica set in which you want to read the data.

Q54) What is a Replica Set?
ans : Replica set is a different server on which the same data in copied as on the primary server
     It makes the mongodb more scalable and highly available.

Q55) How does failover work in a replica set?
ans : 
     An election happens and a new primary is chosen.

Q56) What are the roles of primary and secondary nodes?
ans : primary node is mainly used for write operations
      and secondary nodes are mainly used for read operations.

Q57) What is a shard in MongoDB?

ans : sh.enableSharding("databaseName");
db.adminCommand({ shardCollection: "db.collection", key: { userId: 1 } });


Q62) What is a shard key? How do you choose one?
an :  Choose a shard key with high cardinality and even distribution to avoid bottlenecks.

ans : Because it gives the flexibility in schema, It has the high availability and scalability as compare to RDBMS
      due to its replica sets out of the box, It is faster because it has the eventual consistency not strong consistent, it stores the data in BSON format low latency.

Q89) What‚Äôs the difference between MongoDB and Cassandra?
ans : MongoDB supports rich queries, secondary indexes, and dynamic schema.
      Cassandra is optimized for high write throughput and linear scaling but supports limited queries and strict schema.

# Scenario based questions


 1‚Äì10: CRUD & Querying
Q1) You have a collection with millions of documents. A query using .find({ status: "active" }) is slow. How do you optimize it?
ans : creating index on this field and also create replica sets to transfer the traffic.

Q2) You need to fetch users who signed up within the last 24 hours. How would you query for this efficiently?
ans : write a query like db.collection_name.find({createAt: {$gt : epoch time of last 24 hours}});

Q3) You're getting duplicate user records after running an update. What might be the issue?
ans : Possible cause: Using upsert: true with incorrect query filter.

If the filter doesn't match any existing document and upsert is enabled, it creates a new one ‚Äî possibly duplicating users.

Q4) You want to increment a field viewCount every time a document is read. How would you do this atomically?
ans : use the $inc.

Q5) A document must have a nested field like profile.name.first. How do you ensure it's always present during insert?
ans : use the orm and set required as true.

Q6) You're asked to query orders where items.quantity > 2. The items field is an array. How do you write the query?
ans : db.orders.find({
  items: { $elemMatch: { quantity: { $gt: 2 } } }
});


Q7) How would you update multiple nested fields in a document without overwriting the whole object?

db.users.updateOne(
  { _id: someId },
  {
    $set: {
      "profile.name.first": "Anmol",
      "profile.name.last": "Dhama"
