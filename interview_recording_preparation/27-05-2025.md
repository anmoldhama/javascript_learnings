üü® React.js (Architecture & Optimization)
1. How would you architect a React application for scalability in a large team environment?

Component folder structure, modular state management, atomic design, feature-based folders.

2. How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders in deeply nested components?

React.memo, useMemo, useCallback, keying properly, flattening prop structures.

3. Explain how reconciliation works in React.

Virtual DOM diffing, key-based identification, minimal DOM changes.

4. What are the trade-offs between controlled and uncontrolled components?

Controlled = more power, form logic in React; Uncontrolled = more native, less re-rendering.

5. How do you secure sensitive data like API keys in a React app?

You don't. Keep them in backend; use environment variables only for non-secret keys.

üüß Express.js (Advanced APIs & Auth)
6. How do you implement refresh tokens securely with JWT in Express?

Store refresh token in HttpOnly cookie, rotate on use, validate against DB.

7. What‚Äôs the difference between application-level and router-level middleware in Express?

App-level applies globally; router-level is route-specific and modular.

8. How would you build a custom CORS middleware in Express?

Set headers conditionally: Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Allow-Methods, etc.

9. How can you prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities in Express with MongoDB?

Whitelist allowed fields manually or use libraries like mongoose-schema-clean.

10. How would you throttle login attempts to prevent brute force attacks in an Express app?

Use express-rate-limit, Redis for IP tracking, exponential backoff logic.

üü¶ Node.js (Internals, Debugging & Production)
11. What‚Äôs the difference between fork and spawn in Node.js? When would you use each?

spawn runs a new process, fork spawns a Node process with IPC for communication.

12. How would you debug memory leaks in a Node.js backend running in production?

Use heapdump, clinic.js, memory profiling with Chrome DevTools.

13. How would you implement graceful shutdown in a Node server?

Listen to SIGINT, close connections (DB, HTTP), finish active requests.

14. What‚Äôs the impact of not handling unhandledPromiseRejection in Node.js apps?

Leads to crashes in Node >= 15; must handle globally or locally.

15. What is event loop starvation, and how do you prevent it?

Long sync ops block the loop; use async code, setImmediate, background workers.

üü© MongoDB (Modeling, Transactions, Indexes)
16. How do you design a schema in MongoDB for a product catalog with multiple variants (colors, sizes)?

Use sub-documents or referenced variant collections; depends on read vs write frequency.

17. What is a compound index and when should you use one in MongoDB?

Index on multiple fields; useful for sorting/filtering combinations.

18. How do you use MongoDB transactions to ensure consistency across collections?

Use session.startTransaction() with replica set or sharded cluster.

üåê Full Stack Integration & DevOps
19. How would you build a real-time notification system in a MERN app?

Use WebSocket (Socket.IO) or polling in frontend + events in backend.

20. What are your steps for deploying a production-grade MERN app to AWS (or Vercel, Heroku, etc.)?

Setup CI/CD, Docker (optional), env vars, reverse proxy (Nginx), domain, HTTPS (SSL), monitor logs.
