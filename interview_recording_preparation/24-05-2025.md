first of all introduce yourself?

ðŸ”· MERN Stack â€“ General
Q.1) What is the MERN stack and why is it popular?

Discuss the components (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and benefits like JS throughout, performance, scalability, and rich ecosystem.

Q.2) How does the client-server architecture work in MERN?

Explain how React (client) communicates with Express/Node (server), and how backend communicates with MongoDB.

Q.3) Explain the flow of data in a MERN application.

From frontend input â†’ API call to backend â†’ DB interaction â†’ response â†’ state update in React.

ðŸŸ© MongoDB
Q.4) How is data structured in MongoDB?

BSON documents, collections, schema-less, nested objects/arrays.

Q.5) What are Mongoose schemas and models?   ----confused

Schema defines structure, model is used to interact with the collection.

Q.6) How do you perform CRUD operations using Mongoose?

Methods like .find(), .create(), .updateOne(), .deleteOne().

Q.7) How do you model relationships in MongoDB (1-to-many, many-to-many)?   ----confused

Using embedded documents or references with ObjectId.

ðŸŸ§ Express.js
Q.8) What is middleware in Express and how does it work?

Functions executed during request lifecycle. Eg: auth, logging, body parsing.

Q.9) How do you structure routes in an Express app?

Using Router, separating route handlers, controllers.

Q.10) How do you handle errors in Express?

Error-handling middleware: (err, req, res, next) and try-catch for async.

ðŸŸ¨ React.js
Q.11) What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?

Controlled: React manages state; Uncontrolled: direct DOM access.

Q.12) What is the Virtual DOM and how does React use it?

In-memory DOM used for efficient diffing and rendering.

Q.13) Explain useEffect and its dependency array.

Side-effect hook, runs on mount/update, controls when to re-run.

Q.14) What are React hooks and why were they introduced?

Functions like useState, useEffect for using state/lifecycle in function components.

Q>15) How do you manage global state in a MERN app?

Options: React Context, Redux, Zustand, or third-party solutions.

ðŸŸ¦ Node.js
Q.16) How is Node.js different from traditional server-side platforms like PHP?

Event-driven, non-blocking I/O, single-threaded, fast for I/O tasks.

Q.17) What is the event loop in Node.js?

Explains async behavior, tasks queue, call stack, event loop cycle.

Q.18) How do you handle asynchronous code in Node.js?

Callbacks, Promises, async/await.

ðŸ§© Full-stack & Integration
Q.19) How do you connect React frontend to Node.js backend?

Use fetch or axios to call Express API endpoints.

Q.20) How do you handle authentication in a MERN app?

JWT-based auth (sign/login/verify), storing token in HTTP-only cookie or localStorage, middleware to protect routes.
