üü® React (Advanced)
1. How do you manage complex state across deeply nested components without prop drilling?

Use React Context, Redux, Zustand, or Jotai; compare trade-offs.

2. How does React handle batching of state updates, and how can it affect rendering?

React batches state updates during event handlers to minimize re-renders.

3. How do you implement optimistic UI updates in React?

Temporarily update the UI before server confirms; rollback if error.

4. What are React keys used for, and what happens if you use indexes as keys?

Helps React track elements. Index keys can cause UI bugs on reorder.

5. How would you improve initial page load time for a large React app?

Code splitting, lazy loading, SSR/SSG, caching, image optimization.

üüß Express.js (Middleware & Security)
6. Explain how middleware works in Express and how you'd build a custom one.

Function with (req, res, next) signature; can modify or block flow.

7. How do you prevent NoSQL injection attacks in your Express app using MongoDB?

Sanitize input using libraries like express-mongo-sanitize, validator, and never directly inject user input into queries.

8. How would you rate-limit API requests in an Express server?

Use middleware like express-rate-limit or Redis-based solutions.

9. How do you handle global error logging and monitoring in Express?

Use winston, morgan, Sentry, or custom middlewares for centralized error tracking.

10. What are the best practices for versioning APIs in an Express app?

Prefix routes (/api/v1/...), modularize routes/controllers, avoid breaking changes.

üü¶ Node.js (Performance, Concurrency, Patterns)
11. How does the event loop work in Node.js and how can you block it?

Single-threaded loop that processes events; heavy sync operations block it.

12. Explain how to use the cluster module in Node.js and its use cases.

Fork multiple processes to use multi-core CPUs and handle more requests.

13. How would you create a pub/sub system in Node.js for real-time notifications?

Use Redis pub/sub or EventEmitter, or message brokers like RabbitMQ.

14. What is process.nextTick vs setImmediate in Node.js?

nextTick runs before any I/O; setImmediate runs after I/O in the next event loop phase.

15. How do you handle large file uploads efficiently in Node.js?

Use streams and tools like busboy, multer, or S3 multi-part uploads.

üü© MongoDB (Design & Optimization)
16. How would you model a "likes" system for posts in MongoDB: embedded vs referenced?

Small count ‚Üí embed. Large user base ‚Üí reference. Use indexes for performance.

17. How do you implement soft deletes in MongoDB, and when is it preferable over hard deletes?

Add isDeleted flag or deletedAt timestamp; helps with recovery and auditing.

18. Explain a real use case for MongoDB aggregation pipelines.

Reporting, dashboard metrics, grouped analytics (e.g., revenue by region).

‚öôÔ∏è Full-Stack Integration & DevOps
19. How do you set up a secure login system using JWT in a MERN stack?

Auth route ‚Üí login ‚Üí generate JWT ‚Üí store in HttpOnly cookie or localStorage.

20. What steps would you take to detect and fix a memory leak in your MERN application?

Use clinic, heapdump, Chrome DevTools for Node, limit global scope, manage subscriptions.
