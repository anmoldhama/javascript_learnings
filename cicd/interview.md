🔹 Section 1: CI/CD Fundamentals
Q.1) What is Continuous Integration (CI)?
ans : Continuous integration is a process in which whenever the version control detect any change in the respository then it should trigger the .yml files placed inside the workflows.
      It should help to run the build
      It should helpt to run the tests
      It should help to run the linting/formatting
      before deploying it to the server
      It helps to fix the noticed the issue if any

      Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing code whenever changes are pushed to a shared repository. It involves running workflows that handle tasks like building the application, running unit tests, and checking code formatting/linting. The goal is to detect integration issues early in the development cycle.

Q.2) What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?
ans: Continous Delivery is a process in which prepares the build for release, but requires manual approval.

Q.3) What is Continuous Deployment?
ans : Continous Deployment is a process in which the changes are not deployed directly without manual intervention.

Q.4) How do CI and CD differ?
ans : Ci refers to the building, test script running and code quality checking part
      Cd refers to the code deployement on the server.

Q.5) What are the benefits of implementing CI/CD?
ans : CI/CD improves the code quality and reduce the manual tasks
      They also reduce the efforts to deploy the changes at every push.
      They also give the security and parallelism to the branches of code.
      They automate the code quality and deployement part.
      Early bug detection
      Faster and more reliable deployment

Q.6) What are the key stages of a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : 1) building
      2) Tests
      3) linting/formatting
      4) Deployement

Q.7) How does CI/CD improve software quality?
ans : Because it check the pushed code to build it every time the new changes detected
      It runs the test scripts if any
      It runs the linting and formatting rules.
      Detecting errors early
      Providing rapid feedback to developers
      Preventing regressions through automation

Q.8) What challenges might one face when implementing CI/CD?
ans : 1)Setting up environment-specific configurations
      2)Managing secrets securely
      Integrating with legacy systems
      Docker image creation and orchestration complexity
      Long build times

Q.9) What is the role of version control systems in CI/CD?
ans : version control have actions
      version control have the complete responsitory of code
      version control have workflows files where we write the CI/CD script
      version control triggers the workflows if any change detected.

Q.10) How does CI/CD support agile methodologies?
ans : Using agile methodologies all the departments are doing the tasks parallely
     in sprints developers pushed the code to the dev branch if the task is not ready to delivered to qa
     if the complete task is ready then this should be delivered to qa branch where the seperate 
     CI/CD pipeline is triggered to check the code quality and deplay it to the qa server.
     when the qa signed off then the task moves to the main branch where an another ci/cd is triggered.
     and this process keep continuing in loop.

     Agile emphasizes iterative development. CI/CD supports this by:
Allowing frequent integrations and deployments
Reducing cycle time for delivering features
Ensuring quick feedback
Enabling parallel development via branching and environment-specific pipelines

🔹 Section 2: CI/CD Tools and Technologies
Q.11) What is Jenkins, and how is it used in CI/CD?
ans : Like jenkins is a alternate of github actions thats why i dont use it
      but basicaly jenkins is a automation tools built on java, for automating the building,testing,linting and deployement the application with the use of version controls.
      Whenever any change detect in the responsitory jenkins pull this respository and create a maven project
      for checking code quality and deployement.

      Jenkins is an open-source automation server built in Java. It is used in CI/CD to automate the process of:

Building code

Running tests

Linting/formatting

Deploying applications

It integrates with version control systems like GitHub/GitLab and runs pipelines whenever changes are detected. Jenkins uses Jenkinsfile to define pipeline steps (like build, test, and deploy). It supports plugins to connect with tools like Docker, Maven, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

Q.12) How does GitLab CI/CD work?
ans : 
GitLab CI/CD is a built-in tool in GitLab that automates the software delivery process. It uses a .gitlab-ci.yml file placed in the repo root to define stages like:

build

test

deploy

GitLab runners execute these jobs when a push or merge request is made. GitLab CI/CD supports:

Parallel builds

Manual triggers

Environment deployments

Artifacts and caching

Q.12) What is CircleCI, and what are its advantages?
ans : 
CircleCI is a CI/CD tool that integrates closely with GitHub and Bitbucket. It's cloud-based but also supports self-hosted runners.

Advantages:

Fast builds using caching

Docker-native support

Parallelism for faster job execution

Easy config using .circleci/config.yml

Built-in support for test splitting, workflows, and environment variables

Q.13) How does Travis CI integrate with GitHub?

Travis CI integrates directly with GitHub via OAuth. Once connected:

It detects .travis.yml file in your repo

Automatically runs tests and builds on every push or PR

Provides build logs and status badges

Supports different runtimes (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)

Q.14) What is Bamboo, and how does it support CI/CD?
ans : 

Q.15) How do you configure a Jenkins pipeline?
ans : 
You configure a Jenkins pipeline using a Jenkinsfile, which can be:

Declarative (preferred): YAML-like syntax

Scripted: Groovy-based flexible scripts

Steps:

Install required plugins

Connect your source control (e.g., GitHub)

Add a Jenkinsfile in the root directory

Define stages like build, test, and deploy

Jenkins automatically picks up the pipeline and executes it

Q.16) What is a Jenkinsfile, and what is its purpose?
ans : 
A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the pipeline configuration for Jenkins. It defines stages such as:

Build

Test

Lint

Deploy

Its purpose is to make the CI/CD pipeline:

Version-controlled

Reproducible

Maintainable

Q.17) How does Docker integrate with CI/CD pipelines?
ans : Docker is used in CI/CD pipelines to:

Containerize applications

Build Docker images in the CI stage using Dockerfile

Push images to Docker Hub or other registries

Pull and run containers in the CD stage for deployment

Q.18) What is the role of Kubernetes in CI/CD?
ans : Kubernetes is used in CI/CD for automated deployment and scaling of applications. In the CD phase:

The CI pipeline builds and pushes the Docker image

CD tools (like ArgoCD, Jenkins, GitLab) apply Kubernetes manifests

Kubernetes handles rollout, load balancing, and rollback if needed

This provides a declarative and scalable deployment infrastructure.

Q.19) How do you use Ansible in a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : 
Ansible is used in CI/CD to automate infrastructure and application deployment.

Example usage:

Write Ansible playbooks for tasks like server setup, Docker install, file transfer, etc.

Scenario-based CI/CD questions and answers

🔹 Section 3: Pipeline Configuration and Management
Q.20) What is "pipeline as code"?  not understand
ans : 
"Pipeline as Code" refers to defining your entire CI/CD pipeline in a version-controlled file, typically using YAML or Groovy (e.g., .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, .github/workflows/...).
It allows:

Reproducibility and history tracking

Collaboration via code review

Standardization across teams

Easier debugging and rollback

Q.21) How do you define stages and jobs in GitLab CI/CD?
ans : 

In GitLab CI/CD, you define stages and jobs inside the .gitlab-ci.yml file:

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh

* Each job is linked to a stage, and jobs within the same stage run in parallel.


Q.22) What is the purpose of the .gitlab-ci.yml file?
ans : It is used for ci/cd pipelines for handling testing,building,linting and deployement of the code.

The .gitlab-ci.yml file is used to define GitLab's CI/CD pipeline configuration. It includes:

Stages (like build, test, deploy)

Jobs (what to do in each stage)

Conditions (when and where to run)

Artifacts, cache, variables, and more

It is read by GitLab runners to execute CI/CD workflows automatically.

Q.23) How do you handle artifacts in a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : 
Artifacts are intermediate or final files generated during a job (e.g., test results, build outputs).
To handle them:

Define artifacts: in the job configuration (in .gitlab-ci.yml or Jenkinsfile)

Artifacts can be stored temporarily or downloaded manually

Example in GitLab:

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 hour


Q.24) What is a build artifact, and why is it important?
ans : 

A build artifact is a file or bundle generated during a pipeline, usually after the build stage. Examples include:

Compiled binaries

Docker images

Test reports

Log files

Importance:

Used in further stages (like deploy)

Help in debugging (logs)

Enable storing deployable versions

Useful for auditing and rollback

Q.25) How do you manage dependencies in a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : 
Managing dependencies involves:

Installing packages in isolated environments (e.g., npm ci, pip install -r)

Using lock files (e.g., package-lock.json, requirements.txt) for consistency

Caching them to speed up builds

Declaring them clearly in your CI jobs

Q.26) What strategies can be used for parallel execution in pipelines?
ans : 
Common strategies:

Split jobs into independent units in the same stage

Use matrix builds for different envs or versions

Run multiple containers/runners

Use tools like:

GitHub Actions: strategy.matrix

GitLab: jobs under same stage run in parallel

Jenkins: parallel block in scripted pipeline

Parallelism helps in reducing overall pipeline duration.

Q.27) How do you implement caching in CI/CD pipelines?
ans : 
Caching stores dependencies or build outputs to reuse in future runs.
In Github Actions:
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}


Q.28) What is a build matrix, and how is it useful?
ans : 
A build matrix allows running the same job across multiple combinations (e.g., Node.js versions, OS types).
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [14, 16, 18]

steps:
  - name: Setup Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

Benefits:

Tests compatibility

Saves time via parallel execution

Q.29) How do you handle environment variables securely in pipelines?
ans : use the github actions to store the secret keys.

To securely handle environment variables:

Use secrets manager or CI/CD's built-in secret store

Never hardcode secrets in .yml files

GitHub Actions → use GitHub Secrets

GitLab → use CI/CD Variables (masked & protected)

Jenkins → use Credentials plugin

Example:
env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY_API_KEY }}


🔹 Section 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
Q.30) How do you integrate automated testing into a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : Automated testing is integrated into the CI phase by running test scripts as part of the pipeline. Typically, a command like npm run test or pytest is added to the workflow. The job will fail if tests do not pass, ensuring only validated code proceeds.

Q.31) What types of tests are commonly used in CI/CD?
ans : Unit tests – Validate individual functions or components.

Integration tests – Ensure multiple modules or services work together.

End-to-End (E2E) tests – Simulate real user workflows.

Regression tests – Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

Smoke tests – Basic tests to ensure the app is up and running.

Q.32) How do you measure code coverage in a pipeline?
ans : You configure a test coverage tool like Istanbul/nyc (JavaScript), coverage.py (Python), or JaCoCo (Java) in your testing script. In the CI job, you run tests and generate a coverage report. Many CI tools integrate with Codecov or Coveralls to visualize code coverage.

Q.33) What is the role of static code analysis in CI/CD?
ans: 
Static code analysis scans the codebase for bugs, code smells, and security issues before execution. Tools like ESLint, SonarQube, or Pylint are used in CI pipelines to ensure code quality and enforce coding standards automatically.

Q.34) How do you handle flaky tests in a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : 
Isolate and investigate flaky tests (unreliable tests with inconsistent results).

Retry failed tests using CI config (e.g., retry: 3 in GitLab).

Run flaky tests in quarantine jobs.

Use test stability tracking tools.

Improve test setup, teardown, and mocking.

Q.35) What is test-driven development (TDD), and how does it relate to CI/CD?
ans : 
TDD is a development practice where you write tests before writing actual code. In CI/CD, TDD ensures every push already includes test coverage, improving test-first integration. It promotes early bug detection and continuous testing compatibility.

Q.36) How do you implement integration testing in a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : 
Integration tests are added as a separate job in the CI pipeline. They may spin up databases, services (e.g., using Docker Compose), and test how different modules interact.
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: npm run test:integration


Q.37) What is continuous testing, and how is it achieved?
ans :
Continuous Testing means running tests at every stage of the development lifecycle – on every commit, merge, or deployment. It's achieved using CI tools that run:

Unit tests in the build phase

Integration and E2E tests before deploy

Smoke tests post-deploy

Q.38) How do you manage test data in CI/CD pipelines?
ans : 
Use mock data or seed data scripts

Use fixtures for unit/integration testing

Spin up temporary test databases (Docker containers)

Reset state between tests

Use environment-specific data for QA/Dev pipelines



Q.39) What tools are commonly used for performance testing in CI/CD?
ans :
JMeter – Load and performance testing

k6 – Scriptable performance tests (DevOps-friendly)


🔹 Section 5: Deployment Strategies
Q.40) What is blue-green deployment?
ans: Blue-Green Deployment is a deployment strategy that reduces downtime and risk. You maintain two production environments (Blue and Green).

Blue is the current live version.

Green is the new version to be deployed.

Once the Green version is fully tested, traffic is switched from Blue to Green. If something goes wrong, you can instantly roll back by redirecting traffic back to Blue.

Q.41) How does canary deployment work?
ans : Canary Deployment is a progressive rollout strategy where a new version is deployed to a small subset of users or servers initially.
If the release performs well (no errors or crashes), it is gradually rolled out to the remaining users.
This allows for monitoring in real-world conditions while minimizing risk.

Q.42) What is rolling deployment?
ans : Rolling Deployment is a strategy where the application is updated incrementally on one or more servers at a time, rather than all at once.
Older versions are replaced with the new version gradually, reducing downtime and system load. It ensures continuous availability during deployment.

Q.43) How do you implement feature toggles in CI/CD?
ans : 
Feature toggles (feature flags) allow you to enable or disable features without deploying new code.
They’re used to:

Roll out features gradually

Test in production

Disable failing features quickly

Implementation:

Use tools like LaunchDarkly, Unleash, or simple config files/env variables

Wrap features in conditional logic:

if (featureFlags.newCheckout) {
  renderNewCheckout();
} else {
  renderOldCheckout();
}


Q.44) What is the purpose of a staging environment in CI/CD?
ans : 
A staging environment is a production-like environment used for final testing before deployment.
Purpose:

Validate deployments

Run integration/E2E tests

Perform user acceptance testing (UAT)

Detect bugs that may only appear under production-like settings

Q.45) How do you handle database migrations in a CI/CD pipeline?
ans : Database migrations should be:

Automated in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Flyway, Liquibase, Sequelize CLI, Prisma)

Version-controlled with the code

Executed during the build or deploy stage

example :
- name: Run DB migrations
  run: npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

Best Practices:

Backup the DB before migration

Use backward-compatible schema changes

Monitor for failures

Q.46) What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
ans : Continous delivery refers to the deployement with the manual approval
      continous deployement refers to the deployment without the manual approval.

      | Feature                  | Continuous Delivery                   | Continuous Deployment              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Automation Level         | Code is **built, tested, and staged** | Code is **automatically deployed** |
| Manual Approval Required | ✅ Yes (usually for production)        | ❌ No                               |
| Goal                     | Rapid, safe releases                  | Fully automated releases           |
| Example                  | GitHub Actions triggers staging       | GitHub Actions triggers prod push  |


Q.47) How do you perform a rollback in case of deployment failure?
ans : 
Automated rollback via health checks (e.g., in Kubernetes or load balancers)

Use versioned deployments (e.g., Docker tags)

Re-deploy the last known stable build

For databases, maintain rollback scripts for migrations

Monitor for failures and trigger rollbacks based on alerts

Q.48) What is the role of configuration management in CI/CD?
ans : 
Configuration Management ensures that environment configurations, secrets, and dependencies are consistently managed across environments (dev, staging, prod).

Tools:

Ansible, Chef, Puppet – Manage server configurations

Environment variables, HashiCorp Vault – Manage secrets and env-specific configs

Keeps infra reproducible, secure, and consistent

Q.49) How do you manage infrastructure as code in CI/CD pipelines?
ans : Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows provisioning infrastructure via code, making infra version-controlled and repeatable.

CI/CD pipeline runs IaC tools like:

Terraform – Cloud-agnostic infra management

AWS CloudFormation – AWS infra templates

Pulumi, CDK – Code-first IaC
