Q --> Internal Working of Indexes in MongoDB & Why They're Fast
üì¶ How Indexes Are Stored in MongoDB
MongoDB uses B-trees (more specifically B+ trees) to store indexes.

Index Structure:
Each index in MongoDB is a data structure that maps the values of a field (or set of fields) to the location (_id) of documents.

B+ Tree Characteristics:

Nodes contain sorted keys.

All values (pointers to documents) are stored in leaf nodes.

Internal nodes only store keys to guide searches ‚Äî no data.

Multilevel Hierarchy:
Like a phonebook ‚Äî you don‚Äôt scan everything, just follow paths (root ‚Üí branches ‚Üí leaves).

‚öôÔ∏è Internal Mechanism ‚Äì Step by Step
Collection Creation:
A default _id index is automatically created.

Custom Index Creation (e.g., on { name: 1 }):

MongoDB traverses all documents.

Extracts name field values.

Inserts them into a B+ tree along with pointers to documents.

Storage:

Index data is stored in MongoDB‚Äôs WiredTiger engine (or MMAPv1 in legacy).

Physically stored on disk in separate data files.

Supports compression to save space.

‚ö° Why Indexes Make Retrieval Faster
Without Indexes:

MongoDB performs a collection scan ‚Äî reads every document one by one.

With Indexes:

Binary search on B+ tree (logarithmic time complexity).

Directly jumps to leaf node with the desired value.

Avoids scanning irrelevant documents.

üìä Example
Suppose you run:

db.users.find({ age: 30 });
With no index on age: full scan of all documents.

With { age: 1 } index: binary search through B+ tree ‚Üí jump to exact document(s).

üß† Extra Benefits of Indexes
Compound Indexes: Efficient for queries on multiple fields.

Covered Queries: Return results only using index, no need to fetch documents.

Sorted Results: If index matches sort order, no extra sorting needed.

‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs
Indexes consume disk space.

Every insert/update/delete must update the indexes, which adds overhead.



Q --> Difference between Forward proxy vs Reverse proxy vs Database proxy ?
ans : üåê 1. Forward Proxy (aka Proxy Server)
‚úÖ Definition:
A forward proxy sits between a client (e.g., your browser) and the internet. It represents the client to the outside world.

üîß How It Works:
The client sends a request to the proxy.

Proxy forwards the request to the destination server.

The server sends data back to the proxy.

Proxy sends it to the client.

üîí Use Cases:
Access control (e.g., block YouTube at work)

Anonymity/Privacy (hide IP address)

Content filtering (e.g., parental controls)

Caching to improve response times

üè† Location:
Sits on the client-side of the network.

üì¶ Example:
txt
Copy
Edit
Client --> Forward Proxy --> Web Server
üîÅ 2. Reverse Proxy
‚úÖ Definition:
A reverse proxy sits in front of web servers and represents the server to external clients.

üîß How It Works:
Client makes request to the reverse proxy.

Proxy decides which backend server should handle it.

It forwards the request and sends back the response to the client.

üéØ Use Cases:
Load balancing

SSL termination

Web acceleration (caching, compression)

Application firewall (security)

Microservices gateway

üè† Location:
Sits on the server-side of the network.

üì¶ Example:
txt
Copy
Edit
Client --> Reverse Proxy --> App Server / API Server
Tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB, Traefik, etc.

üõ¢Ô∏è 3. Database Proxy
‚úÖ Definition:
A database proxy sits between an application and a database, managing and optimizing DB access.

üîß How It Works:
App connects to the proxy instead of the DB directly.

The proxy routes SQL queries to the appropriate DB instance.

Can manage connections, cache queries, and handle failover.

üéØ Use Cases:
Connection pooling to handle many client connections

Failover handling in multi-replica DB setups

Query caching

Read/write splitting (write to primary, read from replicas)

Security & audit logging

üè† Location:
Between the application and the database.

üì¶ Example:
txt
Copy
Edit
App --> DB Proxy --> Primary/Replica DBs
Tools: Amazon RDS Proxy, PgBouncer (PostgreSQL), ProxySQL (MySQL), etc.


| Feature        | Forward Proxy        | Reverse Proxy           | Database Proxy               |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Represents     | Client               | Server                  | Database                     |
| Sits Between   | Client ‚Üî Internet    | Client ‚Üî Web Server     | App ‚Üî Database               |
| Primary Use    | Anonymity, filtering | Load balancing, caching | Connection pooling, failover |
| Seen By Server | Proxy IP             | Client IP (if allowed)  | Proxy or client IP           |
| Seen By Client | Configured manually  | Appears as the server   | Transparent to app           |


Q)  Middleware vs Guards vs Pipes ?
   üîÅ 1. Middleware
üìå Use: Request pre-processing ‚Äî similar to Express middleware.
Runs before controller.

Doesn't care about route logic, just shapes/modifies the request or response.

Can log, modify headers, check IPs, etc.

üß† Example Use Cases:
Logging all requests

Adding a timestamp

Parsing custom headers

‚úÖ Example (NestJS):
ts
Copy
Edit
@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next(); // pass to next middleware or controller
  }
}
üõ°Ô∏è 2. Guard
üìå Use: Authorization or condition checking before a route is activated.
Can be async.

Must return true (allow) or false (block), or throw an exception.

Uses metadata (like roles) via decorators.

üß† Example Use Cases:
JWT auth

Role-based access control

Check feature flags or user status

‚úÖ Example (NestJS):
ts
Copy
Edit
@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return request.user?.role === 'admin';
  }
}
üîÑ 3. Pipe
üìå Use: Input transformation and validation.
Works on @Body(), @Param(), etc.

You can use class-validator, transform to types, etc.

Returns the validated/transformed value or throws BadRequestException.

üß† Example Use Cases:
Convert id from string to number

Validate DTOs using class-validator

Sanitize inputs

‚úÖ Example (NestJS):
ts
Copy
Edit
@Injectable()
export class ParseIntPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string) {
    const val = parseInt(value, 10);
    if (isNaN(val)) throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed');
    return val;
  }
}

Incoming Request
   ‚Üì
[MIDDLEWARE] ‚Üí e.g., logging, modifying headers
   ‚Üì
[GUARD] ‚Üí e.g., isAuthenticated, hasRole('admin')
   ‚Üì
[PIPE] ‚Üí e.g., validate body, convert string to int
   ‚Üì
[CONTROLLER] ‚Üí handles logic and returns response

 Q = What is the problems that are occur when using websockets with a microservice architecture ?


 | Problem                             | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sticky Sessions Required**        | WebSocket connections are long-lived and bound to a specific server, which breaks stateless microservices.                       |
| **Connection Loss on Server Crash** | If a server crashes, all its WebSocket connections are dropped.                                                                  |
| **Session Affinity**                | Hard to scale across instances without proper connection affinity.                                                               |
| **Horizontal Scaling**              | Load balancing WebSocket connections is more complex than stateless HTTP.                                                        |
| **Message Broadcasting**            | Broadcasts (e.g., order status updates) must reach clients connected to **any instance**, requiring pub/sub or fanout mechanism. |
| **Service Communication**           | Microservices don‚Äôt talk WebSockets directly. You need to decouple WebSocket edge from internal services.                        |
| **Client State Recovery**           | Server needs to restore/resume client sessions after disconnection.                                                              |
| **Firewall/NAT/Timeouts**           | WebSocket connections can be killed by intermediaries if not kept alive.                                                         |



Q = How to recover the websockets connection when the server goes down ?

üí° Key Principle:
"WebSocket servers should be stateless; state lives in Redis or DB."

‚úÖ Recovery Strategy:
Step 1: Client-Side Reconnect Logic
Use reconnect logic with exponential backoff.

On reconnect, send token/session ID and last known message/order ID.

js
Copy
Edit
socket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/ws?token=abc123");
Step 2: Session Resume on Server
Store session/user data in Redis.

On reconnect, check if session exists and resume subscriptions/state.

Step 3: Stateless WebSocket Edge Layer
Do NOT store user state in memory.

Use Redis/Kafka to store ephemeral connection mappings and deliver messages.

Step 4: Re-subscribe on Reconnect
Re-initiate subscriptions (e.g., orders) based on last known state or ID.

+------------+-------------+
             |
             v
+------------+-------------+
|      Load Balancer       |

             |

|   Microservices (e.g.,    |
|   Order, Chat, Billing)   |
|   REST / Kafka / gRPC     |
+--------------------------+


üöÄ Steps to Make It Fault-Tolerant
‚úÖ Step 1: WebSocket Gateway Layer
Clients connect to a dedicated WebSocket Gateway.

It does not process business logic, only handles client connections and forwards to microservices.

‚úÖ Step 2: Stateless Design
Store all client session and connection metadata in Redis or a distributed cache.

Use connection IDs (or socket IDs) and map to user IDs or session tokens.

‚úÖ Step 3: Pub/Sub Between WS Servers
Use Redis Pub/Sub, NATS, or Kafka to deliver real-time messages to any connected server.

Enables all servers to broadcast messages across clients regardless of which instance they are connected to.

‚úÖ Step 4: Microservices Are Decoupled
Business microservices (e.g., order service) communicate with the WebSocket gateway via message queues or events (Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, gRPC, etc.).

They never talk WebSocket directly.

‚úÖ Step 5: Load Balancer with Health Checks
Use health checks (readiness probes) to detect failed WebSocket servers.

LB (NGINX, ALB) stops sending traffic to them.

‚úÖ Step 6: Client Reconnect Strategy
On client:

js
Copy
Edit
function reconnect() {
  socket = new WebSocket("wss://gateway/ws?token=xyz");
  socket.onopen = () => {
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'RESUME', lastEventId: 123 }));
  };
  socket.onclose = () => setTimeout(reconnect, 2000);
}
On server:

Validate token

Rehydrate session from Redis

Resume subscriptions (like order updates)

‚úÖ Step 7: Heartbeat and Liveness
Server pings clients every 30s

Clients respond with pong

Drop connections that don‚Äôt respond (clean Redis as well)



Q = why are you choose the mongodb if you have only 1000 requests per day


‚ÄúYou're right ‚Äî if I only had 1000 requests per day, I might not need a highly scalable, distributed database. But I chose MongoDB not just for scale, but for its developer productivity, flexibility, and faster prototyping capabilities.

Specifically:

Schema flexibility: My data had nested and dynamic fields (like user settings, metadata), and MongoDB's JSON-like structure made it easier to evolve the schema over time without complex migrations.

Faster iteration: During the initial development and MVP stage, MongoDB allowed me to move fast without worrying about upfront schema design like in SQL.

Document-oriented access: Since my application often needed entire objects (e.g., orders, tickets) in a single call, document reads made more sense than joins.

Tooling and community: MongoDB Atlas provided easy cloud hosting with built-in backups, monitoring, and free tier support ‚Äî ideal for a small app.

Future growth: Even though traffic was low now (1000 req/day), I designed with growth in mind ‚Äî MongoDB gives me room to scale horizontally later if needed, without rearchitecting.
